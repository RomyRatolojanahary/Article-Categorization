21382150,2011,Current and emerging treatment modalities for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Docetaxel-based therapy is established as the standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), based on results from two landmark Phase III studies. However, prognosis remains poor, with a median survival of less than 2 years. There is no standard of care for patients who progress during or after docetaxel treatment, which represents a real unmet medical need. Several small retrospective studies suggest that patients with mCRPC who responded to first-line docetaxel-based therapy are sensitive to re-treatment, but a survival benefit in prospective randomized trials has not been demonstrated. Epithelial-stromal interactions in the tumour microenvironment appear to play a central role in prostate cancer progression and response to therapy. Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin prostate cancer progression have allowed the identification of potential therapeutic targets. New agents, including angiogenesis inhibitors, hormone therapies, chemotherapies, bone targeting agents, vaccines and immunotherapies are currently undergoing clinical development in advanced prostate cancer using docetaxel as a backbone. Several Phase III studies have now been completed. Sipuleucel-T prolonged survival compared with placebo in asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with mCRPC. Cabazitaxel plus prednisone prolonged survival in patients with mCRPC who progressed during or after docetaxel-based therapy compared with the active agent mitoxantrone, plus prednisone. Multidisciplinary management and optimization of the role and timing of new agents in this evolving treatment continuum will be critical to maximizing patient outcomes. Identification of predictive markers and better gene expression profiling will be critical to tailoring therapies to individual patients and disease states, whereas validated surrogate markers of overall survival will help accelerate drug approval."
27018069,2016,"Enzalutamide in Japanese patients with chemotherapy-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: A post-hoc analysis of the placebo-controlled PREVAIL trial.","To evaluate the treatment effects, safety and pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in Japanese patients. This was a post-hoc analysis of the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled PREVAIL trial. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing on androgen deprivation therapy were randomized one-to-one to 160 mg/day oral enzalutamide or placebo until discontinuation on radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent antineoplastic therapy. Coprimary end-points were centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Secondary end-points were investigator-assessed radiographic progression-free survival, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to prostate-specific antigen progression, prostate-specific antigen response (≥50% decline) and time to skeletal-related event. Of 1717 patients, 61 were enrolled in Japan (enzalutamide, n = 28; placebo, n = 33); hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 0.30 for centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (0.03-2.95), 0.59 for overall survival (0.20-1.8), 0.46 for time to chemotherapy (0.22-0.96) and 0.36 for time to prostate-specific antigen progression (0.17-0.75) showed the treatment benefit of enzalutamide over the placebo. Prostate-specific antigen responses were observed in 60.7% of enzalutamide-treated men versus 21.2% of placebo-treated men. Plasma concentrations of enzalutamide were higher in Japanese patients: the geometric mean ratio of Japanese/non-Japanese patients was 1.126 (90% confidence interval 1.018-1.245) at 13 weeks. Treatment-related adverse events grade ≥3 occurred in 3.6% of enzalutamide- and 6.1% of placebo-treated Japanese patients. Treatment effects and safety in Japanese patients were generally consistent with the overall results from PREVAIL."
24314736,2013,[Corticotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer].,"Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer resistant to castration (PCRC), partly due to the inhibitory effects on adrenal androgen production acting as a pituitary suppressant. A literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE database using the following key words: prostate cancer; castration resistance; metastasis; corticotherapy. Corticosteroids exert direct anti-tumoral activities mediated by the glucocorticoids receptor and involving cellular/tissue functions as growth, apoptosis, inflammation, metastasis, differentiation and angiogenesis. As a pain relieving agents, corticosteroids significantly relieve PCRC clinical symptoms, especially those due to bone metastasis. In the comparative arm of phase II-III trials, corticosteroids administered daily produce a PSA decline. Among the adverse effects due to corticosteroids, bone loss and cardiovascular risk should be carefully monitored. In association with abiraterone acetate, corticosteroids increase overall survival in PCRC patients, and reduce the mineralocorticoid side effects of abiraterone. Corticosteroids in monotherapy for PCRC have a limited efficacy. In association with abiraterone acetate it reduces the mineralocorticoid toxicity and enhances the androgenic suppression."
25907622,2015,"Clinical outcomes in a contemporary series of ""young"" patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer who were 60 years and younger.","The prognosis of younger patients with prostate cancer is unclear, and the very few studies assessing those with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have mainly involved patients treated with older therapies. The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a contemporary series of docetaxel-treated patients with mCRPC who were 60 years and younger. We retrospectively identified 134 patients who were 60 years and younger who were treated with docetaxel in 25 Italian hospitals and recorded their predocetaxel history of prostate cancer, their characteristics at the start of chemotherapy, and their postdocetaxel treatment history and outcomes. Most of the 134 consecutive patients with mCRPC received the standard 3-week docetaxel schedule; median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7 months, and 90 patients underwent further therapies after progression. The median overall survival (OS) from the start of docetaxel treatment was 21 months, but OS was significantly prolonged by the postprogression treatments, particularly those based on the new agents such as cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, or enzalutamide. OS was significantly shorter in the patients with a shorter interval between the diagnosis of prostate cancer and the start of docetaxel treatment; those who received hormonal treatment for a shorter period; those with shorter prostate-specific antigen doubling times; and those with lower hemoglobin levels, a worse performance status, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels before starting treatment with docetaxel. The findings of this first study of clinical outcomes in a contemporary series of younger patients with mCRPC showed that their survival is similar to that expected in unselected patients with mCRPC who were of any age."
26633646,2015,Systemic Medical Treatment in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Recommendations for Daily Routine.,"The approval or clinical evaluation of several new agents - cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, and radium-223 - has significantly changed the management of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior to or after docetaxel-based chemotherapy. All of these agents have resulted in a significant survival benefit as compared to their control group. However, treatment responses might differ depending on the associated comorbidities and the extent and biological aggressiveness of the disease. Furthermore, treatment-associated side effects differ between the various drugs. As new drugs become approved, new treatment strategies and markers to best select which patients will best respond to which drug are needed. It is the aim of the current article to i) summarize the data of established treatment options in mCRPC, ii) highlight new developments in medical treatment, iii) provide clinically useful algorithms for the daily routine, and iv) point out future developments in medical treatment."

27474149,2016,"Wedelolactone, an anti-inflammatory botanical, interrupts c-Myc oncogenic signaling and synergizes with enzalutamide to induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.","The c-Myc gene encodes an oncoprotein transcription factor which is frequently up-regulated in almost all cancer types, and is the subject of intense investigation for management of cancer because of its pleiotropic effects controlling a spectrum of cellular functions. However, due of its non-enzymatic nature, development of suitable strategies to block its protein-protein or protein-DNA interaction is challenging. Thus, c-Myc has been recognized as an elusive molecular target for cancer control and various approaches are in development to inhibit c-Myc-transcriptional activity. We observed that wedelolactone (WDL), an anti-inflammatory botanical compound, severely down-regulates the expression of c-Myc mRNA in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, WDL dramatically decreases the protein level, nuclear localization, DNA-binding, and transcriptional activities of c-Myc. c-Myc is a transforming oncogene widely expressed in prostate cancer cells and is critical for maintaining their transformed phenotype. Interestingly, WDL was found to strongly affect the viability of Myc-activated prostate cancer cells, and completely blocks their invasion as well as soft-agar colony-formation in vitro. WDL was also found to down-regulate c-Myc in vivo in nude mice xenografts. Moreover, WDL synergizes with enzalutamide to decrease the viability of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells via induction of apoptosis. These findings reveal a novel anticancer mechanism of the natural compound, WDL, and suggest that the oncogenic function of c-Myc in prostate cancer cells can be effectively down-regulated by WDL for the development of a new therapeutic strategy against Myc-driven prostate cancer."
21076710,2010,"Cabazitaxel, a new taxane with favorable properties.","Cabazitaxel is a new taxane characterized by convenient administration, a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile and a decreased propensity for P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug resistance. In preclinical studies cabazitaxel inhibited cell growth in a wide range of human cancer cell lines, including tumor models expressing Pgp. Phase I clinical trials established that the cabazitaxel side effect profile is similar to that reported for taxanes, with neutropenia and neuropathy being the most commonly reported toxicities. Further clinical studies have revealed that cabazitaxel is clinically active in women with taxaneresistant metastatic breast cancer and in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel. The TROPIC phase III trial concluded that, compared to mitoxantrone/prednisone, the combination cabazitaxel/prednisone conferred a statistically significantly longer overall survival in patients after treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen, providing the basis for its FDA approval in 2010."
23436650,2013,The discovery of novel human androgen receptor antagonist chemotypes using a combined pharmacophore screening procedure.,"Unraveling the mechanisms involved in castration- and therapy-resistant prostate cancer has led to a renewed interest in androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapeutics. Anti-androgens that block the activity of the AR therefore remain a valid therapeutic option. However, they must be more effective than, or display a distinct mechanism of action or binding mode from those of bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, which are currently in clinical use. For that reason, the second-generation anti-androgen MDV3100 was developed. MDV3100, however, shares its 4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group with bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide required for binding to the AR. In this work, we used a combined strategy to find new antagonist structures distinct from the 4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl group to avoid cross-resistance for these compounds and to find structures without agonist activity on mutant ARs (AR W741C and AR T877A). We found two novel chemotypes with AR-antagonistic activity (IC(50): 3-6 μM) by virtual screening and confirmed their biological activity in an androgen-responsive reporter assay. The design of our computational approach was validated by the observation of strongly decreased or absence of agonistic activity on the two mutant ARs. Further structural derivatization to optimize the potency of these compounds can render these chemotypes into very promising, alternative AR antagonists for prostate cancer therapy."
22522765,2012,Castration-resistant prostate cancer: systemic therapy in 2012.,"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous neoplasm in the male population worldwide. It is typically diagnosed in its early stages, and the disease exhibits a relatively indolent course in most patients. Despite the curability of localized disease with prostatectomy and radiation therapy, some patients develop metastatic disease and die. Although androgen deprivation is present in the majority of patients with metastatic prostate cancer, a state of androgen resistance eventually develops. Castration-resistant prostate cancer, defined when there is progression of disease despite low levels of testosterone, requires specialized care, and improved communication between medical and urologic oncologists has been identified as a key component in delivering effective therapy. Despite being considered a chemoresistant tumor in the past, the use of a prostate-specific antigen has paved the way for a new generation of trials for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Docetaxel is a life-prolonging chemotherapy that has been established as the standard first-line agent in two phase III clinical trials. Cabazitaxel, a novel taxane with activity in cancer models resistant to paclitaxel and docetaxel, is the only agent that has been compared to a chemotherapy control in a phase III clinical trial as a second-line therapy; it was found to prolong the overall survival of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel when compared to mitoxantrone. Other agents used in this setting include abiraterone and sipuleucel-T, and novel therapies are continually being investigated in an attempt to improve the outcome for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer."
26829012,2016,Severe neutropenia during cabazitaxel treatment is associated with survival benefit in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): A post-hoc analysis of the TROPIC phase III trial.,"Cabazitaxel significantly improves overall survival (OS) in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing during or after docetaxel, but is associated with a higher rate of grade ≥3 neutropenia compared with docetaxel. We thus examined the relationship between cabazitaxel-induced grade ≥3 neutropenia, baseline neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and treatment outcomes. Data from the experimental arm of the TROPIC phase 3 trial which randomly assigned men with mCRPC to cabazitaxel or mitoxantrone every 3 weeks, both combined with daily prednisone, were analysed. The influence on OS (primary end-point) and progression-free survival (PFS) of at least one episode of grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy was investigated using Cox regression models, adjusted for pain at baseline. The relationships with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses during cabazitaxel therapy and baseline NLR were also analysed. The occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy was associated with a prolonged OS (median 16.3 versus 14.0 months, hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval] = 0.65 [0.43-0.97], p = 0.035), a twice longer PFS (median 5.3 versus 2.6 months, HR = 0.56 [0.40-0.79], p = 0.001) and a higher confirmed PSA response ≥50% (49.8% versus 24.4%, p = 0.005), as compared with patients who did not develop grade ≥3 neutropenia. Grade ≥3 neutropenia was more common in case of NLR <3 as compared with NLR ≥3 at baseline (88.8% versus 75.3%, p = 0.002). Combining low NLR at baseline and grade ≥3 neutropenia during therapy was associated with the longest OS (median 19.2 months) while high NLR at baseline and no grade ≥3 neutropenia was associated with a poor OS (median 12.9 months, HR 0.46 [0.28-0.76], p = 0.002). In the subgroup of neutropenic patients the median OS was 19.7 months in those treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and 16 months on those without G-CSF support. This post-hoc analysis of TROPIC suggests that the occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia with cabazitaxel is associated with improved OS and PFS. Patients with a low NLR at baseline were more likely to develop grade ≥3 neutropenia during cabazitaxel therapy and showed the longest OS. High NLR at baseline and no grade ≥3 neutropenia during therapy was associated with poor outcomes which may suggest insufficient drug exposure or a limited impact on the tumour-associated immune response. Primary or secondary prophylactic use of G-CSF had no adverse impact for outcome. If prospectively confirmed, these results would justify maintaining the intended cabazitaxel dose of 25 mg/m(2) whenever possible."

26083457,2015,Small-Molecule-Mediated Degradation of the Androgen Receptor through Hydrophobic Tagging.,"Androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription is a major driver of prostate tumor cell proliferation. Consequently, it is the target of several antitumor chemotherapeutic agents, including the AR antagonist MDV3100/enzalutamide. Recent studies have shown that a single AR mutation (F876L) converts MDV3100 action from an antagonist to an agonist. Here we describe the generation of a novel class of selective androgen receptor degraders (SARDs) to address this resistance mechanism. Molecules containing hydrophobic degrons linked to small-molecule AR ligands induce AR degradation, reduce expression of AR target genes and inhibit proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines. These results suggest that selective AR degradation may be an effective therapeutic prostate tumor strategy in the context of AR mutations that confer resistance to second-generation AR antagonists."
24458472,2014,Clinical variables associated with PSA response to abiraterone acetate in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This study's objective was to retrospectively identify factors associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response to abiraterone and validate them in an independent cohort. We hypothesized that the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), thought to be an indirect manifestation of tumor-promoting inflammation, may be associated with response to abiraterone. All patients receiving abiraterone at the Princess Margaret (PM) Cancer Centre up to March 2013 were reviewed. The primary end point was confirmed PSA response defined as PSA decline ≥50% below baseline maintained for ≥3 weeks. Potential factors associated with PSA response were analyzed using univariate and multivariable analyses to generate a score, which was then evaluated in an independent cohort from Royal Marsden (RM) NHS foundation. A confirmed PSA response was observed in 44 out of 108 assessable patients (41%, 95% confidence interval 31%-50%). In univariate analysis, lower pre-abiraterone baseline levels of lactate dehydrogenase, an NLR ≤ 5 and restricted metastatic spread to either bone or lymph nodes were each associated with PSA response. In multivariable analysis, only low NLR and restricted metastatic spread remained statistically significant. A score derived as the sum of these two categorical variables was associated with response to abiraterone (P = 0.007). Logistic regression analysis on an independent validation cohort of 245 patients verified that this score was associated with response to abiraterone (P = 0.003). It was also associated with OS in an exploratory analysis. A composite score of baseline NLR and extent of metastatic spread is associated with PSA response to abiraterone and OS. Our data may help understand the role of systemic inflammation in mCRPC and warrant further research."
21854708,2011,New treatment options for castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a urology perspective.,"Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the most clinically advanced form of prostate cancer. Prior to 2004, treatment options for patients with CRPC were limited to palliative care with mitoxantrone. However, two phase III trials in 2004 showed improved survival with docetaxel compared with mitoxantrone in patients with metastatic CRPC. Docetaxel remains the current standard chemotherapy for CRPC. A literature review was conducted to ascertain agents recently approved or in development for CRPC as well as several treatment algorithms being developed in this patient population. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved chemotherapy agents including cabazitaxel, a novel taxane, for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC who were previously treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The immunotherapy sipuleucel-T and the androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, abiraterone, have also just been approved. A number of other novel agents are in clinical development for the management of CRPC. Options for the management of CRPC are rapidly expanding. Based on improved survival with docetaxel in patients with CRPC, chemotherapy is being investigated for use earlier in the prostate cancer disease spectrum. Studies are actively evaluating chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for patients with high risk, localized prostate cancer. A multidisciplinary approach towards patients with difficult-to-manage prostate cancer in which urologists familiarize themselves with these newer systemic agents and refer appropriate patients to oncologists may be beneficial."
27916295,2016,Association of Biomarkers with Serious Cardiac Adverse Events during Abiraterone Acetate Treatment in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Abiraterone acetate is an effective drug for castration-resistant prostate cancer, but cardiac serious adverse events (SAEs) may occur. We studied their association with N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T (TnT) during abiraterone therapy. In a single institution, 17 patients were treated with abiraterone acetate 1 g daily with concomitant prednisone and then switched to dexametasone plus canrenone. Blood samples for PSA, NT-proBNP, and TnT were obtained at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. Five patients (29.4%) experienced G3 to 4 cardiac SAEs after a median of 13 weeks (range, 9-32), including pulmonary edema, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, sinus bradycardia with syncope, and pulmonary edema. At baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months, median NT-proBNP and TnT levels were higher in patients with subsequent cardiac SAEs (P= .03 and P= .04 for NT-proBNP and TnT at 3 months, respectively). After switching to dexametasone and introducing canrenone, no additional cardiac SAEs were noted. Overall response rate was 67%. Our study suggests a higher than expected risk of cardiac SAEs during abiraterone treatment which may well be due to the small sample size and the unrestricted entry criteria. However, baseline and frequent NT-proBNP and TnT monitoring predicted a higher risk for cardiac SAE. Larger studies should confirm our findings."
26331358,2016,Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.,"Reactivated androgen receptor (AR) signaling drives castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The novel AR targeting drugs abiraterone and enzalutamide have improved survival of CRPC patients. However, resistance to these agents develops and patients ultimately succumb to CRPC. Potential mechanisms of resistance include the following: 1) Expression of AR splice variants, such as the AR-V7 isoform, which lacks the ligand-binding domain; 2) AR missense mutations in the ligand-binding domain, such as F876L and T877A; and 3) Mutation or overexpression of androgen biosynthetic enzymes or glucocorticoid receptor. Several novel agents may overcome resistance mechanisms. Galeterone acts through multiple mechanisms that include degradation of AR protein and is being evaluated in CRPC patients positive for AR-V7. EPI-001 and related compounds inhibit AR splice variants by targeting the N-terminal transactivation domain of AR. Promising therapies and novel biomarkers, such as AR-V7, may lead to improved outcomes for CRPC patients."
25139705,2014,[Pharmacotherapy of solid tumors. New hopes and frustrations].,"Recent years have seen dramatic changes in the biological understanding and treatment of solid tumors. Based on the tumor biology, targeting agents have been developed which directly affect the underlying genetic or immunological changes found in specific tumor entities. Significant increases in survival have delivered the functional proof of the concept of targeted and immunological tumor therapy. The management and adherence of the patient as well as optimized cooperation with clinicians are decisive for the results of therapy and disease control.Several solid tumors are currently under investigation in clinical studies evaluating the (sequential) therapy with targeting and immunologically active agents, e.g. tyrosine kinase and mTOR inhibitors, targeting antibodies, such as bevacizumab, specific antagonists, such as enzalutamide and immunological checkpoint inhibitors via PD(L)1 and/or CTLA 4 antibodies.Currently approved agents have dramatically changed the landscape of treatment options especially for prostate cancer. Such agents include hormone therapy with enzalutamide and abiraterone, radiotherapy with cabazitaxel and xofigo (radium 223), metastatic breast cancer (eribulin and everolimus), renal cell carcinoma (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, everolimus and temsirolimus), non-small cell lung cancer (crizotinib and afatinib), colorectal cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (regorafenib) and melanoma (ipilimumab and vemurafenib). The treatment of rarer tumors, such as pancreatic and hepatocellular cancer and soft tissue sarcoma has entered the stage of targeted therapy with the approval of nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel, sorafenib, and eribulin/pazopanib. Current clinical trials are focusing on the best time point and sequence of therapy and also improvement in the management of these promising agents."
27382012,2016,Hybrid Enzalutamide Derivatives with Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Activity Decrease Heat Shock Protein 90 and Androgen Receptor Levels and Inhibit Viability in Enzalutamide-Resistant C4-2 Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) can disrupt the viability of prostate cancer (PCa) cells through modulation of the cytosolic androgen receptor (AR) chaperone protein heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). However, toxicities associated with their pleiotropic effects could contribute to the ineffectiveness of HDACIs in PCa treatment. We designed hybrid molecules containing partial chemical scaffolds of enzalutamide and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), with weakened intrinsic pan-HDACI activities, to target HSP90 and AR in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. The potency of the new molecules, compounds 2-75 [4-(3-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-fluoro-N-(7-(hydroxyamino)-7-oxoheptyl)benzamide] and 1005 [(E)-3-(4-(3-(4-cyano-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-2-thioxoimidazolidin-1-yl)-2-fluorophenyl)-N-hydroxyacrylamide], as inhibitors of nuclear and cytosolic histone deacetylases was substantially lower than that of SAHA in cell-free and in situ assays. Compounds 2-75 and 1005 antagonized gene activation by androgen without inducing chromatin association of AR. Enzalutamide had no effect on the levels of AR or HSP90, whereas the hybrid compounds induced degradation of both AR and HSP90, similar to (compound 1005) or more potently than (compound 2-75) SAHA. Similar to SAHA, compounds 2-75 and 1005 decreased the level of HSP90 and induced acetylation in a predicted approximately 55 kDa HSP90 fragment. Compared with SAHA, compound 2-75 induced greater hyperacetylation of the HDAC6 substrate α-tubulin. In contrast with SAHA, neither hybrid molecule caused substantial hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4. Compounds 2-75 and 1005 induced p21 and caused loss of viability in the enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 cells, with efficacies that were comparable to or better than SAHA. The results suggest the potential of the new compounds as prototype antitumor drugs that would downregulate HSP90 and AR in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells with weakened effects on nuclear HDACI targets."
21577234,2011,Evolving standards in the treatment of docetaxel-refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"The management of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has taken several leaps forward in the past year, with the demonstration of improved overall survival with three novel agents (sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel with prednisone and abiraterone acetate with prednisone), and a significant delay in skeletal-related events observed with denosumab. The pipeline of systemic therapies in prostate cancer remains strong, as multiple agents with a diverse array of mechanisms of action are showing preliminary signs of clinical benefit, leading to more definitive phase III confirmatory trials. In this review, which represents part 1 of a two-part series on metastatic CRPC, we will summarize the mechanisms of resistance to hormonal and chemotherapies and discuss the evolving landscape of treatment options for men with CRPC, with a particular focus on currently approved and emerging treatment options following docetaxel administration, as well as prognostic factors in this post-docetaxel state. As docetaxel remains the standard initial systemic therapy for men with metastatic CRPC for both palliative and life-prolonging purposes, knowledge of these evolving standards will help to optimize delivery of care and long-term outcomes."
25018038,2014,Efficacy of enzalutamide following abiraterone acetate in chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.,"The activity of enzalutamide after prior treatment with both abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) and docetaxel has been examined in several retrospective studies. However, limited data are available on the efficacy of enzalutamide following abiraterone in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To compare the activity of enzalutamide after abiraterone in docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive mCRPC patients. The British Columbia Cancer Agency Cancer Registry was searched for mCRPC patients who received enzalutamide after prior abiraterone. Clinicopathologic characteristics, confirmed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (PSA decline ≥ 50% confirmed ≥ 3 wk later), and survival data were collected. Outcomes on enzalutamide were compared between docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive patients using chi-square for PSA response and log-rank test for time to PSA progression and overall survival (OS). Univariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with confirmed PSA response on enzalutamide, using either chi-square for categorical variables or logistic regression for continuous variables. A total of 115 patients received enzalutamide after abiraterone: 68 had received prior docetaxel and 47 were docetaxel naive. Median time on enzalutamide was 4.1 mo. Confirmed PSA response rates (22% vs 26%; p=0.8), median time to radiologic/clinical progression (4.6 mo vs 6.6 mo; p=0.6), and median OS (10.6 mo vs 8.6 mo; p=0.2) did not differ significantly between docetaxel-experienced and docetaxel-naive patients. No clinical variables (including prior response to abiraterone) were found to associate significantly with confirmed PSA response to enzalutamide. Antitumour activity of enzalutamide following abiraterone was limited in mCRPC patients irrespective of prior docetaxel use. Identifying clinical and molecular factors predictive of response to enzalutamide remains a high priority for future research. We looked at the effectiveness of enzalutamide after abiraterone acetate for treatment of advanced prostate cancer. We found that patients who had received docetaxel chemotherapy before abiraterone gained similar benefit from enzalutamide compared with patients who had not received docetaxel. These results suggest that earlier treatment with docetaxel does not have a large impact on the activity of enzalutamide after abiraterone."
26509262,2015,Divergent Androgen Receptor and Beta-Catenin Signaling in Prostate Cancer Cells.,"Despite decades of effort to develop effective therapy and to identify promising new drugs, prostate cancer is lethal once it progresses to castration-resistant disease. Studies show mis-regulation of multiple pathways in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), reflecting the heterogeneity of the tumors and also hinting that targeting androgen receptor (AR) pathway alone might not be sufficient to treat CRPC. In this study, we present evidence that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway might be activated in prostate cancer cells after androgen-deprivation to promote androgen-independent growth, partly through enhanced interaction of β-catenin with TCF4. Androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were more prone to activate a Wnt-reporter, and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway increased sensitivity of these cells to the second-generation antiandrogen, enzalutamide. Combined treatment of enzalutamide and Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor showed increased growth repression in both androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer cells, suggesting therapeutic potential for this approach."

26044568,2016,"The Epidemiological, Mechanistic and Potential Clinical Role of Androgen Receptor (AR) in Urothelial Carcinoma.","The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that regulates target gene expression. Androgen signaling has been considered a putative explanation for gender differences in urothelial carcinoma (UC) incidence. In the absence of established risk factors, men still experience a threefold risk of UC as compared to women. Multiple investigations to modulate the AR have been performed with in vitro and in vivo models of UC. Down-regulation of the AR has been shown to inhibit UC growth through increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased cell migration. AR activation up-regulates EGFR and HER2/neu expression contributing to UC progression. UC is more easily induced in male than female models and the incidence of chemically-induced UC is decreased by castration and the addition of estrogens; it is increased by testosterone. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been postulated to be androgen-driven in UC and affects chemotherapy sensitivity. UC has not achieved the same therapeutic advances that have been seen in other tumor types in recent years. Androgen-driven events may account for some of the treatment resistance seen in this tumor type. Novel agents which disrupt androgen synthesis and/or AR signaling are in development and some (abiraterone, enzalutamide) are approved for advanced prostate cancer. Biomarker AR-driven clinical trials of highly effective anti-androgen therapy (HEAT) agents in UC present a promising picture."
23042445,2012,Enzalutamide (formerly MDV3100) as a new therapeutic option for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Enzalutamide marks the latest addition to the drugs currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). AFFIRMwas a phase III international randomized trial that evaluated the clinical utility of enzalutamide versus placebo in men with mCRPC who have failed prior docetaxel-containing chemotherapy. Enzalutamide showed a remarkable 37% decreased risk of death with a median overall survival of 18.4 months versus 13.6 months for those who received placebo. These findings confirm the validity of further targeting the androgen receptor as a valid therapeutic approach in prostate cancer despite emergence of castration resistance."
26311471,2015,Novel agents for castration-resistant prostate cancer: Early experience and beyond.,"Androgen deprivation therapy is the initial treatment for men with advanced prostate cancer. Almost all these patients eventually develop progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer despite an initial favorable response. Docetaxel was the first agent to show a survival benefit in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. After cancer progression on docetaxel, patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer had few therapeutic options. A better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy has led to the development of novel agents with distinct mechanisms of action. Prospective, large-scale clinical trials have shown overall survival benefits with the hormonal agents abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, the immunotherapeutic agent sipuleucel T, the chemotherapeutic agent cabazitaxel, and bone-targeted Ra-223. Although these agents provided clinical benefit, treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer remains a major clinical challenge. We recognize many questions, such as methods to select patients for specific treatments, optimal sequencing and drug combinations, and means to overcome drug resistance. There is an urgent need to answer these questions and to establish better treatment strategies. The development of biomarkers that are predictive of treatment results is also required. The present article reviews new castration-resistant prostate cancer treatments, and discusses possible resistant mechanisms as well as potential drug combinations and optimal sequencing."
26454199,2015,Lack of interaction between enzalutamide and warfarin in a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patient.,"Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist used for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Enzalutamide is classified as a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inducer, a moderate 2C9 and 2C19 inducer, and a time-dependent inducer of 1A2. Warfarin's more potent enantiomer is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 2C9 and has a narrow therapeutic window. Enzalutamide is thought to decrease therapeutic warfarin concentrations per pharmacokinetic studies performed during drug development. This case report describes a 59-year-old man undergoing treatment with enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with a history of femoral vein thrombosis. The patient was receiving a total weekly warfarin dose of 37.5 mg prior to starting enzalutamide. Enzalutamide was initiated and warfarin continued at a constant dose without decrease in the patient's INR. The patient continued on enzalutamide and warfarin for 1 year without having any documented subtherapeutic INRs. This report illustrates one case in which the interaction between warfarin and enzalutamide was not clinically significant."
24276853,2013,Evolution of the treatment paradigm for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"As recently as 2004, treatment options for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were limited, with docetaxel the only approved agent conferring a survival benefit. The therapeutic landscape is now very different, with several agents demonstrating prolonged survival since 2010. New agents for the treatment of mCRPC include sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and radium-223. All are now approved for use in this patient group, although the specific licensing terms vary between agents. In addition, denosumab may have utility in patients with bone metastases. A number of novel agents are also in development with promising initial results. However, because these treatment options have proliferated rapidly, there is currently a paucity of clinical evidence regarding their optimal sequencing. Selection of an appropriate treatment option should take into consideration disease characteristics, drug availability and patient choice. In summary, we discuss several new treatment options available for mCRPC and their integration into the current treatment paradigm."
27515296,2016,Uncontrolled diabetes predicts poor response to novel antiandrogens.,"Metabolic abnormalities including hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia have been associated with worse prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa), but there are limited data regarding their impact on the prognosis of castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and the response of novel antiandrogens, namely abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide. Retrospective analysis of 61 patients with CRPC on AA or enzalutamide, treated at the Boston Medical Center, was performed. We evaluated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and BMI within 2months before the initiation of treatment with AA or enzalutamide and progression-free survival (PFS) under this treatment. Regression analysis and analysis of variance were used to evaluate the data. HbA1c levels were found to predict adversely the PFS on the novel agents (df (1, 37), P=0.00, R(2)=0.40, coeff=-3.28). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that there is significant difference in survival between the HbA1c 4.7-5.9% compared with patients with HbA1c 7.8-11.6% (6.72±1.3months, log rank test P<0.0001) LDL (P=0.07), HDL (P=0.14), and triglycerides (P=0.33) were not found to predict PFS. BMI predicted PFS positively (df (1.59), P=0.02, R(2)=0.09, coeff=0.03), but not independently of HbA1c (P=0.07). No significant implications of social and family history, previous chemotherapy regimen, and Gleason score with PFS were found. Multiple markers of patients' health state were not associated with HbA1c values. Uncontrolled diabetes can predict for poor response of CRPC patients to AA and enzalutamide determining PFS under this treatment. Elevated BMI can positively affect PFS at this stage of disease."
21680545,2011,Overcoming chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer.,"Although treatment for prostate cancer has improved over the past several years, taxanes remain the only form of chemotherapy that improves survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In addition to the promising therapeutic cancer vaccines and newly developed agents targeting androgen receptor signaling, chemotherapy-based treatments will likely continue to play a significant role in patients with mCRPC. Recently published data that showed that a second taxane (cabazitaxel) extends survival after progression on docetaxel was a significant step forward, but also highlighted the need to overcome taxane resistance in prostate cancer. Preliminary evidence suggests that several treatment strategies may improve the activity of taxanes in prostate cancer and perhaps enhance clinical outcomes."
25420520,2014,ERG induces taxane resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Taxanes are the only chemotherapies used to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite the initial efficacy of taxanes in treating CRPC, all patients ultimately fail due to the development of drug resistance. In this study, we show that ERG overexpression in in vitro and in vivo models of CRPC is associated with decreased sensitivity to taxanes. ERG affects several parameters of microtubule dynamics and inhibits effective drug-target engagement of docetaxel or cabazitaxel with tubulin. Finally, analysis of a cohort of 34 men with metastatic CRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy reveals that ERG-overexpressing prostate cancers have twice the chance of docetaxel resistance than ERG-negative cancers. Our data suggest that ERG plays a role beyond regulating gene expression and functions outside the nucleus to cooperate with tubulin towards taxane insensitivity. Determining ERG rearrangement status may aid in patient selection for docetaxel or cabazitaxel therapy and/or influence co-targeting approaches."
27572899,2016,Cabazitaxel-induced autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway contributes to A549 cell death.,"Cabazitaxel has been used to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2010. However, whether cabazitaxel may inhibit the proliferation of other tissue‑derived cancer cells, and its underlying mechanism, remains unknown. In the present study, the A549 lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell line was exposed to cabazitaxel, in order to investigate its cytotoxic effect and determine the underlying mechanism. The results demonstrated that cabazitaxel was able to induce autophagy in A549 cells, as evidenced by the formation of autophagosomes, upregulated LC3‑II expression and increased LC3 puncta. Cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy had a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells, as evidenced by the induction of cell death and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, which was independent of the apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, transfection with Beclin1 small interfering RNA and treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3‑methyladenine protected cells from cabazitaxel‑induced cell death, thus confirming that cabazitaxel‑induced autophagy contributed to A549 cell death. In addition, cabazitaxel targeted the phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to induce autophagy, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that cabazitaxel exerts a cytotoxic effect on A549 cells by acting on the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to promote autophagic cell death. This result supports the potential use of cabazitaxel as a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of lung cancer."
24314737,2013,[Prostate cancer and new hormonal treatments: mechanism of action and main clinical results].,"New drugs have recently been developed, through a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the progression of prostate cancer, including castration-resistant ones (CRPC). This article aims to describe the mechanisms of action of these new hormonal treatments and their major clinical outcomes and development programs. A bibliographic research in French and English using Medline(®) and Embase(®) using the keywords ""castration-resistant prostate cancer"", ""abiraterone acetate"", ""orteronel"", ""enzalutamide"", and ""clinical trials"" was performed. the androgen signaling pathway remains the cornerstone of advanced cancers management. Hence, some molecules target the androgen biosynthesis, as abiraterone acetate and orteronel, which are selective inhibitors of the enzyme CYP17. Others act as antagonists of the androgen receptor: the enzalutamide, RNA-509 and ODM201. Finally, galeterone combines the two effects. Progress conferred by these molecules in terms of overall survival and quality of life in patients with metastatic CRPC, suggest that their use at earlier stages of the disease could reduce morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer. Determining the best strategy for sequence or combination therapy to optimize the use of these new molecules should be investigated."
25927139,2015,Inhibition of Plk1 represses androgen signaling pathway in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in males in the United States. Majority of prostate cancers are originally androgen-dependent and sensitive to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), however, most of them eventually relapse and progress into incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Of note, the activity of androgen receptor (AR) is still required in CRPC stage. The mitotic kinase polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is significantly elevated in PCa and its expression correlates with tumor grade. In this study, we assess the effects of Plk1 on AR signaling in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa cells. We demonstrate that the expression level of Plk1 correlated with tumorigenicity and that inhibition of Plk1 caused reduction of AR expression and AR activity. Furthermore, Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 down-regulated SREBP-dependent expression of enzymes involved in androgen biosynthesis. Of interest, Plk1 level was also reduced when AR activity was inhibited by the antagonist MDV3100. Finally, we show that BI2536 treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in LNCaP CRPC xenografts. Overall, our data support the concept that Plk1 inhibitor such as BI2536 prevents AR signaling pathway and might have therapeutic potential for CRPC patients."
27822685,2016,Sequencing Treatment for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer diagnosed in men and the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the USA. While most cases are diagnosed in early stages, some will present as or progress to metastatic disease and eventually castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) which has a mortality rate exceeding 50 %. There are currently six approved systemic life-prolonging therapies for use in mCRPC, yet little data to guide sequencing. Clinical factors, including the presence or absence of symptoms and the presence or absence of visceral metastases, should help determine the best therapeutic choice at each treatment node. Those with asymptomatic bone-only disease could be considered for sipuleucel-T, abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel in the first-line setting. For symptomatic disease, docetaxel could be used or radium-223 if disease is only present in the bone. In the second-line setting, sipuleucel-T or radium-223 can be used in the appropriate clinical setting. Taxane chemotherapy could be used if a novel androgen-directed therapy was used in the first-line setting. Cabazitaxel, if docetaxel was previously used, should be considered. There is scarce data on best treatment options in the third-line setting. In general, we recommend alternating between androgen-targeting agents and taxane chemotherapy. Finally, consideration should be given to testing for the androgen receptor splice variant AR-V7, which may be a relevant treatment-specific biomarker to aid in the selection of androgen-targeting therapy versus chemotherapy at each treatment juncture. Mutation testing for DNA damage repair defects can also be considered, as such patients may benefit from investigational poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapies. Several ongoing studies have been designed to answer some of these sequencing questions, including the biomarker questions, and will hopefully continue to inform us about rational therapy selection in mCRPC."
25856659,2015,Clinical perspectives: practical insights from clinical experience with cabazitaxel in Australia.,"Prostate cancer, and in particular the management options for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), remains an important health issue. The approval of cabazitaxel provides a new treatment option for patients who have progressed despite docetaxel therapy. Clinical use of cabazitaxel in mCRPC is based on the results of the TROPIC study, which demonstrated an approximately 30% reduction in the risk of death compared with mitoxantrone. In this paper, we draw on accumulating clinical experience with cabazitaxel in Australia to discuss important questions such as how to select the right patient for treatment and how to proactively prevent and manage toxicities associated with this therapy. Recognizing the need for a multidisciplinary approach to patient care, opinion and insight has been sought from medical oncologists, nurses and pharmacists. While lack of trial data means that a number of questions remain unanswered, local clinical experience has helped to guide treatment decisions and refine management protocols. Appropriate patient selection, careful ongoing monitoring and proactive management of adverse events will ensure optimal treatment of patients. Nurses in particular play an important role in educating patients and identifying patients at increased risk of developing adverse events with cabazitaxel. The oncology team must work together to educate patients; taking a proactive approach to issues such as adverse events will help maximize the clinical outcome of cabazitaxel treatment and impact positively on the patient's quality of life."

25848909,2015,Treatment patterns and clinical effectiveness in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer after first-line docetaxel.,"Treatment for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in community settings is not well understood. To examine treatment patterns, sequencing, and outcomes in patients receiving second- and third-line treatment after first-line docetaxel. We used a community oncology database to identify patients who progressed after line 1 docetaxel (D) and received line 2 cabazitaxel (DC), abiraterone (DA), or other therapy (DO). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan- Meier and Cox regression models. Line 3 included subsets DCA and DAC. Line 2 groups (DC = 60 patients, DA = 71, DO = 153) did not differ significantly on demographic and clinical characteristics or median PFS on docetaxel therapy. Cox regression for OS by line 2 groups showed increased risk for DA compared with DC (HR, 1.69; P = .026) when 24 untreated DO patients were excluded. A similar nonsignificant pattern was observed when the 24 untreated patients were included. Of patients receiving DC in line 2, a nominally greater proportion received A in line 3 (57%, 34 of 60 patients) than did patients who received DA in line 2 followed by C in line 3 (25%, 18 of 71). There was a small sample for line 3, and unexamined confounds and selection biases in observational research. Conclusions Treatment patterns in community settings following docetaxel are complex and may involve multiple hormonal agents prior to disease progression. Cabazitaxel may not be optimally used in advanced disease. Although Cox regression showed increased risk of death for DA compared with DC, results need to be validated prospectively.

24741024,2014,Chromogranin A predicts outcome in prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone.,"In this retrospective study, we evaluated the chromogranin A (CgA) baseline value as a predictor of clinical outcome in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treated with abiraterone 1000 mg per day, whose disease progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy. In the 48 evaluable patients, serum CgA level was normal when <120  ng/ml (group A, n=16), within three times the upper normal value (UNV) when between 120 and 360 (group B, n=16), more than three times the UNV when ≥360  ng/ml (group C, n=16). Decline in PSA level ≥50% or more (PSA RR) was observed in 26 of 48 (54%) patients. PSA response rate did not correlate with the CgA groups. CgA levels more than three times the UNV predicted an early radiological progressive disease in eight of 11 cases (73%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) among the CgA groups A, B, and C was 9.2, 9.2, and 4.8 months respectively, P=0.0459. The median overall survival (OS) among the CgA groups was 19.0, 18.8, and 10.8 months respectively, P=0.2092. In the multivariate analysis, PSA RR (nonresponsive vs responsive) and CgA levels (group 3 vs groups 1+2) were predictors of PFS (P=0.0002 and P=0.0047 respectively), whereas PSA RR only was significantly associated with OS (P=0.0024), while CgA levels remained of borderline significance (P=0.0919). A serum CGA level more than three times the UNV predicted PFS and showed a trend vs OS prediction, independently from PSA response, in CRPC patients treated with abiraterone."
28191869,2017,Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation."
28183253,2017,Optimal Management of Prostate Cancer Based on its Natural Clinical History.,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in males and, despite a marked improvement in diagnostic techniques, a not small percentage of prostate tumours is still diagnosed in advanced stage. It is now clear that prostate cancer passes through distinct phases during its natural history, starting from an initial phase, in which the disease has a locoregional extent, until a very late phase when it becomes refractory to hormone therapy. It is important to distinguish between local disease, in which tumor may be considered localized in the gland and a systemic disease characterized by high tumor burden and/or dissemination of circulating tumour cells. All the prostate cancers, at first diagnosis, are characterized by high sensitivity to the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); however, during the natural history, after a variable period, they become castration resistant. In the past, few therapy options were available for castration resistant prostate cancer, while at present much more approaches can be employed, both hormone-based therapies and chemotherapy regimens. Hypercastration agents are defined as drugs capable to target the androgen-androgen receptor axis even in castrate resistant conditions. Abiraterone and enzalutamide are the only two hypercastration agents available for clinical use. Osteoclast targeted agents, such as zoledronic acid and denosumab can always been employed, but their use should be limited to the castrate resistant setting. The optimal understanding of all phases characterizing the natural history of prostate cancer may certainly be useful for the selection of the best therapeutic options in prostate cancer."
26585210,2016,Addition of PSMA ADC to enzalutamide therapy significantly improves survival in in vivo model of castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Despite multiple new therapies available to patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the overall survival benefit still remains relatively short. Therefore, it is important to investigate additional treatment options that could achieve greater efficacy. Because of tumor heterogeneity and the development of resistance to treatment with single agents, combination therapies using existing drugs with new agents can potentially broaden individual therapeutic windows and achieve improved efficacy and safety profiles. The objective of the current studies was to evaluate the efficacy of combination of enzalutamide (ENZ) with prostate specific membrane antigen antibody drug conjugate (PSMA ADC) to inhibit CRPC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) in a preclinical setting. Subcutaneous LuCaP 96CR prostate cancer PDX bearing mice were treated with a single dose of PSMA ADC (2.0 mg/kg) or 5 days a week ENZ (50 mg/kg) as monotherapy or with a combination of these two agents. The effects of the PSMA ADC+ENZ combination were compared to PSMA ADC alone, ENZ alone, and placebo control. IHC analyses were performed to determine PSMA, AR, ARV7, and GR expression and effects on proliferation. All treatments inhibited tumor progression but with different efficacy. At 6 weeks, in the control and ENZ groups all tumors were progressing, while in the PSMA ADC group only 5/11 were progressing, two remained unchanged and four tumors had decreased tumor volume. Moreover, all animals in the PSMA ADC+ENZ group had smaller tumors at week 6 when compared to their size at enrollment (week 0). A 14-week followup showed that all three treatments resulted in significant survival benefits but the combination effects were the most pronounced resulting in PSMA ADC+ENZ versus ENZ HR = 0.093 (P = 0.0045) and PSMA ADC+ENZ versus PSMA ADC HR = 0.051 (P = <0.0001) with no deaths observed in the combination group. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of PSMA ADC+ENZ possesses strong antitumor activity and significantly improves survival over ENZ monotherapy using the LuCaP 96CR PDX model. These results provide a strong rationale for clinical testing of PSMA ADC in combination with ENZ and/or other androgen-directed treatment strategies."
27618249,2016,Quality of life and pain relief in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on cabazitaxel: the non-interventional QoLiTime study.,"To examine health-related quality of life in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer on cabazitaxel. Men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving cabazitaxel (25 mg/m², every 3 weeks) and 10 mg/day oral prednis(ol)one were enrolled (2011-2014) in the non-interventional prospective QoLiTime study. Primary outcome was change in quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 30 item) with respect to PSA response after 4 cycles of cabazitaxel. Secondary outcomes included occurrence of adverse events. Of 527 men, 348 received 4 cycles of cabazitaxel and 266 had sufficient PSA measurements. After 4 cycles, 92 (34.6%) men had a PSA decrease ≥50% (responders). Quality of life remained stable throughout the study (P=0.62). Change in quality of life did not differ between responders and non-responders (P=0.69). Change in PSA and global health status between baseline and 4 cycles showed an inversely proportional relationship (correlation coefficient -0.14; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.01; P=0.03), with increasing PSA corresponding to lower health status. Responders showed no change in physical functioning versus baseline (-1.75, P=0.12); non-responders showed a reduction versus baseline (-7.00, P<0.0001) and responders (P=0.05). Responders showed an improvement in pain vs baseline (-7.61, P=0.05) and non-responders (P=0.01). Adverse events occurred in 292 patients (55.4%), most commonly anaemia (16.5%), fatigue (12.3%) and diarrhoea (11.8%). Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were reported in 3.8% and 3.6% of patients, respectively. PSA response was associated with stable physical functioning and improvement in pain. Symptom increases were seen in areas typical of chemotoxicity, but quality of life was maintained. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
26992199,2016,Multifaceted and personalized therapy of advanced prostate cancer.,"A number of molecular and genomic biomarkers that possess the ability to guide treatment or 'actionable targets' are being reported in metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, pathways of resistance to existing therapies and novel agents to overcome them are currently under active investigation. The next wave of investigations is focused on personalized therapy of prostate cancer. The focus of this review article is to provide an update on clinical development in advanced prostate cancer and to highlight the ongoing investigations of biomarker discovery, and ways of overcoming therapeutic resistance. The next generation of clinical trials developing novel targets and compounds promises to be in populations enriched with specific marker expression. The breakthrough report, of the ability of the androgen receptor variant 7 mutation, detected in circulating tumor cells, to predict the lack of response to abiraterone or enzalutamide, and the remarkable responses of poly adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase inhibitors in prostate cancer with DNA repair mutations have elevated hopes of a bright future in the biomarker-driven therapeutic arena. Novel targets such as bromodomain extra terminal-1 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hold promise for the possibility of overcoming resistance. Novel hormone agents are also under active study. As the clinical application of the multifaceted therapies narrows down to enriched patient populations selected by genomic testing, the therapeutic efficiency will escalate considerably. Novel targets, resistance mechanisms and relevant agents are being avidly tested, and the dream of personalized medicine is emerging into reality."
