25046451,2015,Cytotoxic chemotherapy in the contemporary management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).,"For several years, docetaxel was the only treatment shown to improve survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). There are now several novel agents available, although chemotherapy with docetaxel and cabazitaxel continues to play an important role. However, the increasing number of available agents will inevitably affect the timing of chemotherapy and therefore it may be important to offer this approach before declining performance status renders patients ineligible for chemotherapy. Patient selection is also important to optimise treatment benefit. The role of predictive biomarkers has assumed greater importance due to the development of multiple agents and resistance to available agents. In addition, the optimal sequence of treatments remains undefined and requires further study in order to maximize long-term outcomes. We provide an overview of the clinical data supporting the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of mCRPC and the emerging role in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer. We review the key issues in the management of patients including selection of patients for chemotherapy, when to start chemotherapy, and how best to sequence treatments to maximise outcomes. In addition, we briefly summarise the promising new chemotherapeutic agents in development in the context of emerging therapies.",C2
25193433,2014,Effectiveness and safety of cabazitaxel plus prednisolone chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostatic carcinoma: data on Korean patients obtained by the cabazitaxel compassionate-use program.,"To report the efficacy and safety of using cabazitaxel plus prednisolone chemotherapy to treat Korean patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) following docetaxel therapy. This cohort study enrolled 26 mCRPC patients. Treatment consisted of 25 mg/m(2) cabazitaxel that was intravenously administered every 3 weeks, in addition to twice-daily 5 mg prednisolone. The median patient age was 67 years (range = 53-82), median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 (range = 0-2), Gleason score was ≥ 8 in 25 patients (96 %), and median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 95.3 ng/mL (interquartile range = 9.1-297.7). A total of 180 treatment cycles were administered, and a median of five cycles were administered per patient (range = 1-23). A PSA response was observed in 32 % of evaluable patients. Tumor response was evaluated in eight patients, and three and four patients achieved partial response and stable disease, respectively. Over a median follow-up duration of 23.4 months (95 % CI 11.1-35.6), median time to treatment failure was 4.2 months (95 % CI 1.8-6.6) and median time to progression was 8.5 months (95 % CI 3.0-13.1). Median overall survival was 16.5 months (95 % CI 12.1-20.9). Grade 3 or worse febrile neutropenia developed in eight patients (31 %) and neutropenic infection in four patients (15 %). Cabazitaxel plus prednisolone chemotherapy can be used to treat Korean mCRPC patients. Prophylactic growth factor support should be considered for patients at high risk of neutropenic fever or infection.",C2
27815387,2016,Polycomb-Mediated Disruption of an Androgen Receptor Feedback Loop Drives Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"The lethal phenotype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is generally caused by augmented signaling from the androgen receptor (AR). Here, we report that the AR-repressed gene CCN3/NOV inhibits AR signaling and acts in a negative feedback loop to block AR function. Mechanistically, a cytoplasmic form of CCN3 interacted with the AR N-terminal domain to sequester AR in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells, thereby reducing AR transcriptional activity and inhibiting cell growth. However, constitutive repression of CCN3 by the Polycomb group protein EZH2 disrupted this negative feedback loop in both CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. Notably, restoring CCN3 was sufficient to effectively reduce CPRC cell proliferation in vitro and to abolish xenograft tumor growth in vivo Taken together, our findings establish CCN3 as a pivotal regulator of AR signaling and prostate cancer progression and suggest a functional intersection between Polycomb and AR signaling in CRPC.

25687355,2015,"Safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.","Enzalutamide (MDV3100) is a second-generation androgen receptor antagonist that improves survival in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Alternatives include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy and abiraterone. The Phase I/II study showed early evidence of efficacy and determined that fatigue is the dose-limiting toxicity. Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated superiority of enzalutamide 160 mg by mouth daily over placebo in terms of overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival as well as a broad range of secondary and exploratory end points in men who had received previous chemotherapy (AFFIRM) and in those who were chemotherapy naive (PREVAIL). Common side effects include fatigue, arthralgias and constipation. A post hoc analysis from AFFIRM found that enzalutamide is safe and effective in men aged ≥ 75 years. The Phase I/II studies as well as AFFIRM and PREVAIL are described in this review. Enzalutamide extends overall and progression-free survival and is associated with robust response rates and quality of life benefits in men with mCRPC. Enzalutamide has not been proven to be effective in biochemically relapsed disease or in castration-sensitive prostate cancer. It should not be used in men at high risk for seizure, and patients should be counseled about the increased risk of falls.",E3
23044721,2012,Peg-filgrastim and cabazitaxel in prostate cancer patients.,"To determine the impact of prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating growth factor (G-CSF) on the risk of febrile neutropenia in a cohort of patients enrolled at the University Federico II of Naples and treated with cabazitaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We carried out a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of patients enrolled at our institution in a compassionate-use programme with cabazitaxel, aimed at providing early access to the drug before its commercial availability in mCRPC patients. Besides baseline clinical and demographic characteristics, data on treatment efficacy and toxicity, as well as those on the use of G-CSF per patient per cycle were extracted. Progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Fisher's exact test was used to explore a relationship between a single event of grade 3 or more neutropenia or febrile neutropenia and previous use of G-CSF. Univariate analysis was carried out to evaluate predictors of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia. Of 34 patients enrolled at our institution from December 2010 to December 2011, 32 had received at least one dose of cabazitaxel and were included in the analysis. Patients received a median of 10 cabazitaxel cycles. Grade 3 or more neutropenia was common, occurring in 64.5% of patients. Three patients (9.3%) developed febrile neutropenia. Twenty-seven patients received prophylaxis with G-CSF during at least one cycle using peg-filgrastim. The risk of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia per patient and per cycle was seven times lower when G-CSF was used. Baseline neutrophil count of less than 4570/mm was the strongest predictor of grade 3 or more neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia. No toxic death was reported. Only one patient discontinued cabazitaxel because of an adverse event. Our analysis suggests that prophylaxis with peg-filgrastim may considerably reduce the incidence of grade 3 or more neutropenia and, possibly, of febrile neutropenia in mCRPC patients treated with cabazitaxel. Further analyses involving a larger population are warranted to confirm our results.",C2
28304025,2017,Illuminating cytochrome P450 binding: Ru(ii)-caged inhibitors of CYP17A1.,New Ru(ii)-caged abiraterone complexes were synthesized that exhibit strong absorption in the visible region and release the steroidal CYP17A1 inhibitor abiraterone upon exposure to low energy visible light in buffer and prostate cancer cells. Photoinduced release results in abiraterone binding to its CYP17A1 target in an inhibitory mode.,A1
21984773,2011,Emerging treatments for castrate-resistant prostate cancer.,"Castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a challenging aspect in the treatment of prostate cancer. Research has identified several pathways in the pathogenesis of CRPC. Several new agents targeting some of these pathways have shown promising data during clinical trials. In the area of androgen depletion, abiraterone acetate and MDV100 have been studied and have shown to decrease prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in phase I and II studies. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody antiangiogenesis agent that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and has shown to decrease PSA levels in combination with other cytotoxic agents. Three agents, ixabepilone, patupilone, and sagopilone, in the class of epothilones (tubulin polymerizing antitumor agents), have shown moderate reductions in PSA levels and moderate adverse effects. The results of ongoing studies with these new treatment agents may offer viable alternatives to the traditional treatment of CRPC to decrease disease progression and improve overall survival.",A1
23098113,2012,Cabazitaxel in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) has a poor prognosis and remains a significant therapeutic challenge. Prior to 2010, docetaxel chemotherapy was the only treatment shown to improve overall survival, symptom control and quality of life in patients with CRPC. Research efforts focused on overcoming chemoresistance to taxanes eventually led to the development of multiple novel anti-tumor agents, including cabazitaxel. Cabazitaxel has recently been shown to significantly improve overall survival compared with mitoxantrone in a large multicenter Phase III study. This article details the preclinical and clinical development of cabazitaxel and discusses the importance of this novel chemotherapy in CRPC. The authors also discuss the challenges now facing the future use of cabazitaxel in CRPC, including the determination of the optimal dose of cabazitaxel in patients with advanced CRPC, the ideal sequencing of cabazitaxel relative to other anti-tumor treatments, appropriate patient selection and novel strategies for the assessment of treatment response.",C2
28117385,2017,Radiographic progression with nonrising PSA in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post hoc analysis of PREVAIL.,"Advanced prostate cancer is a phenotypically diverse disease that evolves through multiple clinical courses. PSA level is the most widely used parameter for disease monitoring, but it has well-recognized limitations. Unlike in clinical trials, in practice, clinicians may rely on PSA monitoring alone to determine disease status on therapy. This approach has not been adequately tested. Chemotherapy-naive asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic men (n=872) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated with the androgen receptor inhibitor enzalutamide in the PREVAIL study were analyzed post hoc for rising versus nonrising PSA (empirically defined as >1.05 vs ⩽1.05 times the PSA level from 3 months earlier) at the time of radiographic progression. Clinical characteristics and disease outcomes were compared between the rising and nonrising PSA groups. Of 265 PREVAIL patients with radiographic progression and evaluable PSA levels on the enzalutamide arm, nearly one-quarter had a nonrising PSA. Median progression-free survival in this cohort was 8.3 months versus 11.1 months in the rising PSA cohort (hazard ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.26-2.23); overall survival was similar between the two groups, although less than half of patients in either group were still at risk at 24 months. Baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar. Non-rising PSA at radiographic progression is a common phenomenon in mCRPC patients treated with enzalutamide. As restaging in advanced prostate cancer patients is often guided by increases in PSA levels, our results demonstrate that disease progression on enzalutamide can occur without rising PSA levels. Therefore, a disease monitoring strategy that includes imaging not entirely reliant on serial serum PSA measurement may more accurately identify disease progression.Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases advance online publication, 24 January 2017; doi:10.1038/pcan.2016.71.",E3
26786788,2016,Role of corticosteroids in prostate cancer progression: implications for treatment strategy in metastatic castration-resistant patients.,"Corticosteroid agents (CA) are widely used in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) either as concomitant treatment with active agents such as docetaxel, cabazitaxel and abiraterone or in a palliative setting, predominantly due to their anti-inflammatory activity. However, the chronic use of CA has numerous side effects, especially in case of steroid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Furthermore, the latest clinical and preclinical data demonstrate that CA themselves are likely to promote tumour progression in certain populations of patients with mCRPC. Therefore, the role of CA in advanced disease should be carefully weighed for each patient and their withdrawal should be considered in some patients. This is necessary, especially in clinical trials that need good performance status patients to evaluate the activity and the safety of emerging drugs in mCRPC that do not require the concurrent use of CA. In oncology, there is no consensus on an algorithm of gradual steroid tapering and frequently the approach to this procedure is empirical. An algorithm is presented in this article based on clinical observations. Prospective studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the above-proposed algorithm in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.",A1
26052050,2015,The third line of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer patients: Option or strategy?,"New agents for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) developed in the past 3 years include cabaziataxel (Cbz), abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (E). In this review, the results of clinical studies in which one of these drugs is included as the third line of treatment are discussed. Our review suggests that AA and E have limited activity, while Cbz seems to retain its efficacy. Prospective studies that further examine sequential treatments are warranted.",E3
26779767,2016,Influence of abiraterone acetate on circulating neuromediators in chemotherapy-naïve castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Abiraterone Acetate (AA) represents a highly effective androgen-receptor (AR) axis targeted agent. Treatment with AA in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) may partly mediate neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) as an escape mechanism, which may have implications for the choice of sequential therapy in CRPC. We evaluated how treatment with AA influences circulating neuromediators chromogranin A (CGA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients. We conducted an analysis in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients with clinical or radiographic progression of disease. A total of 35 patients were included at five institutions between February 2013 and December 2014. Sixteen of them had received AA. Serum samples were obtained before a docetaxel-based chemotherapy and analyzed in a reference laboratory. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to test the influence of AA treatment, its duration of treatment, and other clinicopathological variables on circulating neuromediators. CGA and NSE levels were above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in n = 20 (57.1%) and n = 13 (37.1%), respectively. Treatment with AA and duration of treatment were not associated with levels above the ULN (CGA and NSE) or higher levels (Pro-GRP) of neuromediators. CGA levels were associated with age (P = 0.092), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.014), duration of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; P = 0.083), and intake of proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.069). Pro-GRP levels were significantly associated with PSA levels (P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, CGA levels above the ULN were significantly correlated with ADT (P = 0.01) and intake of proton pump inhibitors (P = 0.03). Circulating neuromediators in chemotherapy-naïve CRPC patients were elevated in a high percentage of patients. ADT was found to be a relevant NED driver in this cohort. Our results may imply that patients with CRPC after first-line treatment with AA in CRPC are not at a higher risk for developing NED. The major limitation of the study represents the one-time analysis of neuromediators. Larger studies with serial blood measurements or biopsy analysis before and after treatment are needed to confirm our results.",A1
27052650,2016,Anti-tumour activity of platinum compounds in advanced prostate cancer-a systematic literature review.,"For men with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), several treatment options are available, including androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors (abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide), taxanes (docetaxel, cabazitaxel) and the radionuclide (radium-223). However, cross-resistance is a clinically relevant problem. Platinum compounds have been tested in a number of clinical trials in molecularly unselected prostate cancer patients. Advances in CRPC molecular profiling have shown that a significant proportion of patients harbour DNA repair defects, which may serve as predictive markers for sensitivity to platinum agents. To systematically identify and analyse clinical trials that have evaluated platinum agents in advanced prostate cancer patients. PubMed was searched to identify published clinical trials of platinum agents in advanced prostate cancer. The PRIMSA statement was followed for the systematic review process. Identified trials are analysed for study design, statistical plan, assessments of anti-tumour activity and the potential value of predictive biomarkers. A total of 163 references were identified by the literature search and 72 publications that met the selection criteria were included in this review; of these 33 used carboplatin, 27 cisplatin, 6 satraplatin, 4 oxaliplatin and 2 other platinum compounds. Overall, anti-tumour activity varies in the range of 10%-40% for objective response and 20%-70% for PSA decline ≥50%. Response seemed highest for the combinations of carboplatin with taxanes or oxaliplatin with gemcitabine. The interpretation of the clinical data is limited by differences in response criteria used and patient populations studied. Platinum compounds have moderate anti-tumour activity in molecularly unselected patients with advanced prostate cancer. Translational evidence of DNA repair deficiency should be leveraged in future studies to select prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from platinum-based therapy.",A1
22184395,2012,Effects of abiraterone acetate on androgen signaling in castrate-resistant prostate cancer in bone.,"Persistent androgen signaling is implicated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progression. This study aimed to evaluate androgen signaling in bone marrow-infiltrating cancer and testosterone in blood and bone marrow and to correlate with clinical observations. This was an open-label, observational study of 57 patients with bone-metastatic CRPC who underwent transiliac bone marrow biopsy between October 2007 and March 2010. Patients received oral abiraterone acetate (1 g) once daily and prednisone (5 mg) twice daily. Androgen receptor (AR) and CYP17 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry, testosterone concentration by mass spectrometry, AR copy number by polymerase chain reaction, and TMPRSS2-ERG status by fluorescent in situ hybridization in available tissues. Median overall survival was 555 days (95% CI, 440 to 965+ days). Maximal prostate-specific antigen decline ≥ 50% occurred in 28 (50%) of 56 patients. Homogeneous, intense nuclear expression of AR, combined with ≥ 10% CYP17 tumor expression, was correlated with longer time to treatment discontinuation (> 4 months) in 25 patients with tumor-infiltrated bone marrow samples. Pretreatment CYP17 tumor expression ≥ 10% was correlated with increased bone marrow aspirate testosterone. Blood and bone marrow aspirate testosterone concentrations declined to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels and remained suppressed at progression. The observed pretreatment androgen-signaling signature is consistent with persistent androgen signaling in CRPC bone metastases. This is the first evidence that abiraterone acetate achieves sustained suppression of testosterone in both blood and bone marrow aspirate to less than picograms-per-milliliter levels. Potential admixture of blood with bone marrow aspirate limits our ability to determine the origin of measured testosterone.",A1
27195316,2016,"The PREVAIL trial of enzalutamide in men with chemotherapy-naïve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Post hoc analysis of Korean patients.","This post hoc analysis evaluated treatment effects, safety, and pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide in Korean patients in the phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled PREVAIL trial. Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic chemotherapy-naive men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressed on androgen deprivation therapy received 160 mg/d oral enzalutamide or placebo (1:1) until death or discontinuation due to radiographic progression or skeletal-related event and initiation of subsequent therapy. Coprimary end points were centrally assessed radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included investigator-assessed rPFS, time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, PSA response (≥50% decline), and time to skeletal-related event. Of 1,717 total patients, 78 patients were enrolled in Korea (enzalutamide, n=40; placebo, n=38). Hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) for enzalutamide versus placebo were 0.23 (0.02-2.24) for centrally assessed rPFS, 0.77 (0.28-2.15) for OS, 0.21 (0.08-0.51) for time to chemotherapy, and 0.31 (0.17-0.56) for time to PSA progression. A PSA response was observed in 70.0% of enzalutamide-treated and 10.5% of placebo-treated Korean patients. Adverse events of grade ≥3 occurred in 33% of enzalutamide-treated and 11% of placebo-treated Korean patients, with median treatment durations of 13.0 and 5.1 months, respectively. At 13 weeks, the plasma concentration of enzalutamide plus N-desmethyl enzalutamide was similar in Korean and non-Korean patients (geometric mean ratio, 1.04; 90% confidence interval, 0.97-1.10). In Korean patients, treatment effects and safety of enzalutamide were consistent with those observed in the overall PREVAIL study population (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01212991).",E3
20823238,2010,Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer require full-length androgen receptor.,"Androgen receptor (AR) splice variants lacking the ligand binding domain (ARVs), originally isolated from prostate cancer cell lines derived from a single patient, are detected in normal and malignant human prostate tissue, with the highest levels observed in late stage, castration-resistant prostate cancer. The most studied variant (called AR-V7 or AR3) activates AR reporter genes in the absence of ligand and therefore, could play a role in castration resistance. To explore the range of potential ARVs, we screened additional human and murine prostate cancer models using conventional and next generation sequencing technologies and detected several structurally diverse AR isoforms. Some, like AR-V7/AR3, display gain of function, whereas others have dominant interfering activity. We also find that ARV expression increases acutely in response to androgen withdrawal, is suppressed by testosterone, and in some models, is coupled to full-length AR (AR-FL) mRNA production. As expected, constitutively active, ligand-independent ARVs such as AR-V7/AR3 are sufficient to confer anchorage-independent (in vitro) and castration-resistant (in vivo) growth. Surprisingly, this growth is blocked by ligand binding domain-targeted antiandrogens, such as MDV3100, or by selective siRNA silencing of AR-FL, indicating that the growth-promoting effects of ARVs are mediated through AR-FL. These data indicate that the increase in ARV expression in castrate-resistant prostate cancer is an acute response to castration rather than clonal expansion of castration or antiandrogen-resistant cells expressing gain of function ARVs, and furthermore, they provide a strategy to overcome ARV function in the clinic.",E3
26100946,2016,Androgen receptor aberrations in the era of abiraterone and enzalutamide.,"Prostate cancer is the most prevalent non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men of the western world. As growth and differentiation of prostate cancer largely depend on androgens, inhibition of the androgen/androgen receptor signaling axis is the main treatment for locally advanced and/or metastatic tumors. Although first-line androgen deprivation therapies like chemical/surgical castration and/or administration of anti-androgens are able to control the disease for several years, prostate cancer almost invariably recurs as castration-resistant prostate cancer. This stage of the disease is characterized by a sustained AR-signaling despite castrate levels of circulating androgens. Various molecular mechanisms were shown to induce castration resistance. This review will discuss the most recent and relevant experimental findings on AR-signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer in order to provide a comprehensive interpretation of the clinical behavior of this tumor entity following treatments with abiraterone, enzalutamide, ARN-509 or taxanes.",A1
21174534,2010,Cabazitaxel for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Treatment with docetaxel-based chemotherapy results in improved survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, all patients eventually develop progressive disease associated with poor outcomes. In this article, we discuss the available second-line therapeutic options following docetaxel, with a special focus on cabazitaxel, which is the first agent to yield extended survival as second-line therapy following docetaxel. Cabazitaxel, a novel semi-synthetic taxane, is effective even in docetaxel-resistant model systems. Recently, results of the Phase III TROPIC trial demonstrated improved survival with cabazitaxel plus prednisone compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone in patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, following prior docetaxel, which led to approval by the US FDA.",C2

In this paper, we provide a personal view and an algorithm for mCRPC patients, according to available evidence, personal opinion and experience. Abiratone acetate, cabazitaxel, radium-223, sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide, together with docetaxel, have demonstrated a survival benefit in these patients. The use of rechallenge with docetaxel in mCRPC patients with disease progression after a first response has been considered. These new agents complicated the scenario and posed the challenge to move from the old sequential to a new algorithm-based approach. At this stage, the algorithm is necessarily based on experts' opinion, since the efficacy of a single agent in a specific setting has not been validated by sequential trials.",C2

25593303,2015,Improvements in Radiographic Progression-Free Survival Stratified by ERG Gene Status in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Abiraterone Acetate.,"Gene fusions leading to androgen receptor-modulated ERG overexpression occur in up to 70% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers (mCRPC). We assessed the association between ERG rearrangement status and clinical benefit from abiraterone acetate. COU-AA-302 is a phase III trial comparing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus prednisone in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC. ERG status was evaluated by FISH on archival tumors. End points included radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), rate of ≥50% PSA decline from baseline, and overall survival (OS). Cox regression was used to evaluate association with time-to-event measures and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel for PSA response. ERG status was defined for 348 of 1,088 intention-to-treat patients. ERG was rearranged in 121 of 348 patients with confirmed ERG status (35%). Cancers with an ERG fusion secondary to deletion of 21q22 and increased copy number of fusion sequences (class 2+ Edel) had a greater improvement in rPFS after abiraterone acetate and prednisone [22 vs. 5.4 months; HR (95% confidence interval, CI), 0.31 (0.15-0.68); P = 0.0033] than cancers with no ERG fusion [16.7 vs. 8.3 months; 0.53 (0.38-0.74); P = 0.0002] or other classes of ERG rearrangement. There was also greater benefit in this subgroup for TTPP. Both ERG-rearranged and wild-type cancers had a significant improvement in rPFS with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in the COU-AA-302 trial. However, our data suggest that 2+ Edel cancers, accounting for 15% of all mCRPC patients and previously associated with a worse outcome, derived the greatest benefit.",A1
23575870,2013,Methylselenol prodrug enhances MDV3100 efficacy for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"The next-generation antiandrogen MDV3100 prolongs overall survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, patient responses are variable, and survival benefit remains relatively small. Developing effective modality to improve MDV3100 efficacy is urgently needed. Recent evidence suggests that constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) drive resistance to MDV3100. In our study, we show that methylselenol prodrug downregulates the expression and activity of both the full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-Vs. The downregulation is independent of androgen and could be attributable to repressed transcription of the AR gene. Cotreatment with methylselenol prodrug and MDV3100 suppresses AR signaling more dramatically than either agent alone, and synergistically inhibits the growth of CRPC cells in vitro. The combinatorial efficacy is observed in not only AR-V-expressing cells but also cells expressing predominantly AR-FL, likely owing to the ability of the two drugs to block the AR signaling cascade at distinct steps. Ectopic expression of AR-FL or AR-V7 attenuates the combinatorial efficacy, indicating that downregulating AR-FL and AR-V7 is importantly involved in mediating the combinatorial efficacy. Significantly, methylselenol prodrug also downregulates AR-FL and AR-Vs in vivo and substantially improves the antitumor efficacy of MDV3100. These findings support a potential combination therapy for improving MDV3100 efficacy, and provide a rationale for evaluating the clinical application of combining methylselenol prodrug with MDV3100 for the treatment of CRPC.",E3
25375370,2014,20(S)-protopanaxadiol inhibition of progression and growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapies remains the most critical challenge in the clinical management of prostate cancer. Resurgent androgen receptor (AR) activity is an established driver of castration-resistant progression, and upregulation of the full-length AR (AR-FL) and constitutively-active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) has been implicated to contribute to the resurgent AR activity. We reported previously that ginsenoside 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-aglycone (PPD) can reduce the abundance of both AR-FL and AR-Vs. In the present study, we further showed that the effect of PPD on AR expression and target genes was independent of androgen. PPD treatment resulted in a suppression of ligand-independent AR transactivation. Moreover, PPD delayed castration-resistant regrowth of LNCaP xenograft tumors after androgen deprivation and inhibited the growth of castration-resistant 22Rv1 xenograft tumors with endogenous expression of AR-FL and AR-Vs. This was accompanied by a decline in serum prostate-specific antigen levels as well as a decrease in AR levels and mitoses in the tumors. Notably, the 22Rv1 xenograft tumors were resistant to growth inhibition by the next-generation anti-androgen enzalutamide. The present study represents the first to show the preclinical efficacy of PPD in inhibiting castration-resistant progression and growth of prostate cancer. The findings provide a rationale for further developing PPD or its analogues for prostate cancer therapy.",E3
25719830,2015,Androgen receptor expression in circulating tumour cells from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with novel endocrine agents.,"Abiraterone and enzalutamide are novel endocrine treatments that abrogate androgen receptor (AR) signalling in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we developed a circulating tumour cells (CTCs)-based assay to evaluate AR expression in real-time in CRPC and investigated nuclear AR expression in CTCs in patients treated with enzalutamide and abiraterone. CTCs were captured and characterised using the CellSearch system. An automated algorithm to identify CTCs and quantify AR expression was employed. The primary aim was to evaluate the association between CTC AR expression and prior treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide. AR expression in CTCs was evaluated in 94 samples from 48 metastatic CRPC patients. We observed large intra-patient heterogeneity of AR expression in CTCs. Prior exposure to abiraterone or enzalutamide was not associated with a change in CTCs AR expression (median intensity and distribution of AR-positive classes). In support of this, we also confirmed maintained nuclear AR expression in tissue samples collected after progression on abiraterone. AR staining also identified additional AR-positive CD45-negative circulating cells that were CK-negative/weak and therefore missed using standard protocols. The number of these events correlated with traditional CTCs and was associated with worse outcome on univariate analysis. We developed a non-invasive method to monitor AR nuclear expression in CTCs. Our studies confirm nuclear AR expression in CRPC patients progressing on novel endocrine treatments. Owing to the significant heterogeneity of AR expression in CTCs, studies in larger cohorts of patients are required to identify associations with outcome.",A1
18985049,2008,CYP17 inhibition as a hormonal strategy for prostate cancer.,"Androgen receptor (AR) signaling has a key role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. AR gene amplification, AR overexpression, and activating mutations in the AR occur more frequently as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) evolves, with intratumoral androgen levels remaining sufficient for AR activation despite castration. The source of these androgens might be either adrenal or intratumoral. AR signaling, therefore, remains a valid treatment target for patients with CRPC. CYP17 is a key enzyme for androgen biosynthesis. The imidazole antifungal agent ketoconazole weakly and nonspecifically inhibits CYP17, but remains unlicensed for this indication. Chemists at the Cancer Research UK Centre for Cancer Therapeutics have designed a novel, selective, irreversible inhibitor of CYP17 called abiraterone, which is more than 20 times more potent than ketoconazole. Abiraterone acetate, a prodrug, has undergone phase I assessment, and is rapidly progressing from phase II to phase III trials, in view of its high level of antitumor activity. This agent is safe and well tolerated, and activity profiles suggest that approximately 50% of CRPC remains AR-ligand driven. Other CYP17 inhibitors with alternative mechanisms of action, for example VN/124-1, are in preclinical development. The rationale for and implications of CYP17 inhibition and the CYP17-targeting agents in development are discussed in this Review.",A1

An understanding of resistance mechanisms has led to new therapies for prostate cancer (cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide), all of which have improved survival following first-line docetaxel. Another treatment, currently in development, targets the prosurvival molecule clusterin. Custirsen, an antisense molecule that inhibits clusterin production, has shown promise in combination with docetaxel in mCRPC patients at risk for poor outcomes. Although optimal sequence and combination of available therapies is unclear, the heterogeneity of mCRPC suggests a continuing need for personalized treatment regimens and improved abilities to predict which patients will respond to the available treatment options.",A1

28223364,2017,Protein kinase C regulates Twist1 expression via NF-κB in prostate cancer.,"The progression of prostate cancer to metastatic and castration-resistant disease represents a critical step. We previously showed that protein kinase C (PKC) activation followed by Twist1 and androgen receptor (AR) induction played a critical role in castration resistance, but the precise molecular mechanism remains unknown. This study aimed to elucidate the relevant molecular mechanism, focusing on NF-κB transcription factor. We examined the activity of NF-κB after PKC inhibition, and the expression of Twist1 and AR after inhibition of NF-κB in human prostate cancer cells. We also investigated the status of PKC/NF-κB after inhibition of AR signaling in cells resistant to hormonal therapy. As a result, inhibition of PKC signaling using knockdown and small-molecule inhibition of PKC suppressed RelA activity, while blocking NF-κB suppressed Twist1 and AR expression. Conversely, inhibition of AR signaling by androgen depletion and the novel antiandrogen enzalutamide induced PKC and RelA activation, resulting in Twist1/AR induction at the transcript level. Moreover, inhibition of NF-κB signaling prevented enzalutamide-induced Twist1 and AR induction. Finally, NF-κB was activated in both castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells. In conclusion, NF-κB signaling was responsible for Twist1 upregulation by PKC in response to AR inhibition, resulting in aberrant activation of AR. NF-κB signaling thus appears to play a critical role in promoting both castration resistance and enzalutamide resistance in PKC/Twist1 signaling in prostate cancer.",E3
27477525,2016,Enzalutamide in Men with Chemotherapy-naïve Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Extended Analysis of the Phase 3 PREVAIL Study.,"Enzalutamide significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS) among men with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer at the prespecified interim analysis of PREVAIL, a phase 3, double-blind, randomized study. We evaluated the longer-term efficacy and safety of enzalutamide up to the prespecified number of deaths in the final analysis, which included an additional 20 mo of follow-up for investigator-assessed rPFS, 9 mo of follow-up for OS, and 4 mo of follow-up for safety. Enzalutamide reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 68% (hazard ratio [HR] 0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.37; p<0.0001) and the risk of death by 23% (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67-0.88; p=0.0002). Median investigator-assessed rPFS was 20.0 mo (95% CI 18.9-22.1) in the enzalutamide arm and 5.4 mo (95% CI 4.1-5.6) in the placebo arm. Median OS was 35.3 mo (95% CI 32.2-not yet reached) in the enzalutamide arm and 31.3 mo (95% CI 28.8-34.2) in the placebo arm. At the time of the OS analysis, 167 patients in the placebo arm had crossed over to receive enzalutamide. The most common adverse events in the enzalutamide arm were fatigue, back pain, constipation, and arthralgia. This final analysis of PREVAIL provides more complete assessment of the clinical benefit of enzalutamide. PREVAIL is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01212991.

25344864,2014,Androgen deprivation therapy sensitizes prostate cancer cells to T-cell killing through androgen receptor dependent modulation of the apoptotic pathway.,"Despite recent advances in diagnosis and management, prostrate cancer remains the second most common cause of death from cancer in American men, after lung cancer. Failure of chemotherapies and hormone-deprivation therapies is the major cause of death in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, the androgen inhibitors enzalutamide and abiraterone are approved for treatment of metastatic CRPC. Here we show for the first time that both enzalutamide and abiraterone render prostate tumor cells more sensitive to T cell-mediated lysis through immunogenic modulation, and that these immunomodulatory activities are androgen receptor (AR)-dependent. In studies reported here, the NAIP gene was significantly down-regulated in human prostate tumor cells treated in vitro and in vivo with enzalutamide. Functional analysis revealed that NAIP played a critical role in inducing CTL sensitivity. Amplification of AR is a major mechanism of resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we show that enzalutamide enhances sensitivity to immune-mediated killing of prostate tumor cells that overexpress AR. The immunomodulatory properties of enzalutamide and abiraterone provide a rationale for their use in combination with immunotherapeutic agents in CRPC, especially for patients with minimal response to enzalutamide or abiraterone alone, or for patients who have developed resistance to ADT.",E3

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies resulted in the identification of a potent compound whose activity is comparable to that of MDV3100. Homology modeling and molecular mechanics were used to build a structural model of the androgen receptor-ligand binding domain and to investigate the structural basis of the antagonism. The model is qualitatively consistent with the observed SAR. Moreover, the enrichment plot shows that screening with the model performs significantly better than random screening. Therefore, the model probably represents a realistic conformation of the antagonist form and can be utilized for structure-based design of novel antiandrogens.",E3
27358841,2016,New drugs in prostate cancer.,"The standard primary treatment for advanced prostate cancer has been hormonal therapy since the 1940s. However, prostate cancer inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after a median duration of 18 months of androgen deprivation therapy. In patients with CRPC, docetaxel has been regarded as the standard treatment. However, survival advantages of docetaxel over other treatments are slim, and the need for new agents persists. In recent years, novel agents, including abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, radium-223, and sipuleucel-T, have been approved for the treatment of CRPC, and more such agents based on diverse mechanisms are under investigation or evaluation.

26907461,2016,Skeletal metastases and impact of anticancer and bone-targeted agents in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Incidence of bone metastases is very high in advanced prostate cancer patients. Bone metastases likely have a significant impact on functional status and quality of life, not only related to pain, but also to the relevant risk of skeletal-related events. A better understanding of mechanisms associated with bone metastatic disease secondary to prostate cancer and more specifically to the cross-talk between tumor cells and bone microenvironment in metastatic progression represented the background for the development of new effective bone-targeted therapies. Furthermore, a better knowledge of biological mechanisms driving disease progression led to significant advances in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer, with the development and approval of new effective drugs. Aim of this review is to outline the physiopathology of bone metastases in prostate cancer and summarize the main results of clinical trials conducted with different drugs to control morbidity induced by skeletal metastases and bone disease progression. For each agent, therapeutic effect on bone metastases has been measured in terms of pain control and/or incidence of skeletal-related events, usually defined as a composite endpoint, including the need for local treatment (radiation therapy or surgery), spinal cord compression, pathological bone fractures. In details, data obtained with chemotherapy (mitoxantrone, docetaxel, cabazitaxel), new generation hormonal agents (abiraterone, enzalutamide), radium-223, bone-targeted agents (zoledronic acid, denosumab) and with several experimental agents (cabozantinib, dasatinib, anti-endothelin and other agents) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer are reviewed.",C2
27794047,2016,Inhibition of AKR1C3 Activation Overcomes Resistance to Abiraterone in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Abiraterone suppresses intracrine androgen synthesis via inhibition of CYP17A1. However, clinical evidence suggests that androgen synthesis is not fully inhibited by abiraterone and the sustained androgen production may lead to disease relapse. In the present study, we identified AKR1C3, an important enzyme in the steroidogenesis pathway, as a critical mechanism driving resistance to abiraterone through increasing intracrine androgen synthesis and enhancing androgen signaling. We found that overexpression of AKR1C3 confers resistance to abiraterone while downregulation of AKR1C3 resensitizes resistant cells to abiraterone treatment. In abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer cells, AKR1C3 is overexpressed and the levels of intracrine androgens are elevated. In addition, AKR1C3 activation increases intracrine androgen synthesis and enhances androgen receptor (AR) signaling via activating AR transcriptional activity. Treatment of abiraterone-resistant cells with indomethacin, an AKR1C3 inhibitor, overcomes resistance and enhances abiraterone therapy both in vitro and in vivo by reducing the levels of intracrine androgens and diminishing AR transcriptional activity. These results demonstrate that AKR1C3 activation is a critical mechanism of resistance to abiraterone through increasing intracrine androgen synthesis and enhancing androgen signaling. Furthermore, this study provides a preclinical proof-of-principle for clinical trials investigating the combination of targeting AKR1C3 using indomethacin with abiraterone for advanced prostate cancer.

23699654,2013,NF-κB2/p52 induces resistance to enzalutamide in prostate cancer: role of androgen receptor and its variants.,"Resistance of prostate cancer cells to the next-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide may be mediated by a multitude of survival signaling pathways. In this study, we tested whether increased expression of NF-κB2/p52 induces prostate cancer cell resistance to enzalutamide and whether this response is mediated by aberrant androgen receptor (AR) activation and AR splice variant production. LNCaP cells stably expressing NF-κB2/p52 exhibited higher survival rates than controls when treated with enzalutamide. C4-2B and CWR22Rv1 cells chronically treated with enzalutamide were found to express higher levels of NF-κB2/p52. Downregulation of NF-κB2/p52 in CWR22Rv1 cells chronically treated with enzalutamide rendered them more sensitive to cell growth inhibition by enzalutamide. Analysis of the expression levels of AR splice variants by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting revealed that LNCaP cells expressing p52 exhibit higher expression of AR splice variants. Downregulation of expression of NF-κB2/p52 in VCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells by short hairpin RNA abolished expression of splice variants. Downregulation of expression of either full-length AR or the splice variant AR-V7 led to an increase in sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. These results collectively demonstrate that resistance to enzalutamide may be mediated by NF-κB2/p52 via activation of AR and its splice variants.",E3
26685010,2016,A prognostic index model for predicting overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone acetate after docetaxel.,"Few prognostic models for overall survival (OS) are available for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with recently approved agents. We developed a prognostic index model using readily available clinical and laboratory factors from a phase III trial of abiraterone acetate (hereafter abiraterone) in combination with prednisone in post-docetaxel mCRPC. Baseline data were available from 762 patients treated with abiraterone-prednisone. Factors were assessed for association with OS through a univariate Cox model and used in a multivariate Cox model with a stepwise procedure to identify those of significance. Data were validated using an independent, external, population-based cohort. Six risk factors individually associated with poor prognosis were included in the final model: lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal (ULN) [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.31], Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 (HR = 2.19), presence of liver metastases (HR = 2.00), albumin ≤4 g/dl (HR = 1.54), alkaline phosphatase > ULN (HR = 1.38) and time from start of initial androgen-deprivation therapy to start of treatment ≤36 months (HR = 1.30). Patients were categorized into good (n = 369, 46%), intermediate (n = 321, 40%) and poor (n = 107, 13%) prognosis groups based on the number of risk factors and relative HRs. The C-index was 0.70 ± 0.014. The model was validated by the external dataset (n = 286). This analysis identified six factors used to model survival in mCRPC and categorized patients into three distinct risk groups. Prognostic stratification with this model could assist clinical practice decisions for follow-up and monitoring, and may aid in clinical trial design. NCT00638690.",A1

22074657,2011,New and emerging agents for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Most men with recurrent prostate cancer (CaP) initially respond to androgen deprivation therapy but eventually develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Over the last decade, new therapeutic targets have been identified in CRPC and several new drugs have reached advanced stages of clinical development. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sipuleucel-T and cabazitaxel, and in 2011, abiraterone for patients with metastatic CRPC based on phase 3 trials showing improved survival. Although not yet available for clinical use, a press release in June 2011 announced that radium 223 also demonstrated a survival advantage in men with metastatic CRPC. Emerging therapies in advanced stages of clinical development in CRPC include the hormonal therapies MDV3100 and TAK 700, and the immunotherapy ipilimumab. Results are also pending on phase 3 studies comparing docetaxel plus prednisone with docetaxel given with the novel agents aflibercept, dasatinib, lenalidomide, and custirsen. In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid. While the addition of these new treatment options is a great advance for men with metastatic CRPC, there are many new questions arising regarding sequencing of these treatments with each other, with previously existing therapies, and with the emerging agents now in clinical trials. Furthermore, there are concerns that on-going phase 3 trials may be contaminated if patients go off study treatment to start 1 of the newly approved agents or take the agent subsequently.

27462143,2016,Effect of N-methyl deuteration on metabolism and pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide.,"The replacement of hydrogen with deuterium invokes a kinetic isotope effect. Thus, this method is an attractive way to slow down the metabolic rate and modulate pharmacokinetics. Enzalutamide (ENT) acts as a competitive inhibitor of the androgen receptor and has been approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. To attenuate the N-demethylation pathway, hydrogen atoms of the N-CH3 moiety were replaced by the relatively stable isotope deuterium, which showed similar pharmacological activities but exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We estimated in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters for ENT and its deuterated analog (d3-ENT). For in vitro studies, intrinsic primary isotope effects (K H/K D) were determined by the ratio of intrinsic clearance (CLint) obtained for ENT and d3-ENT. The CLint values were obtained by the substrate depletion method. For in vivo studies, ENT and d3-ENT were orally given to male Sprague Dawley rats separately and simultaneously to assess the disposition and metabolism of them. We also investigated the main metabolic pathway of ENT by comparing the rate of oxidation and hydrolysis in vitro. The in vitro CLint (maximum velocity/Michaelis constant [V max/K m]) of d3-ENT in rat and human liver microsomes were 49.7% and 72.9% lower than those of the non-deuterated compound, corresponding to the K H/K D value of ~2. The maximum observed plasma concentration, C max, and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the last measurable sampling time point (AUC0-t) were 35% and 102% higher than those of ENT when orally administered to rats (10 mg/kg). The exposure of the N-demethyl metabolite M2 was eightfold lower, whereas that of the amide hydrolysis metabolite M1 and other minor metabolites was unchanged. The observed hydrolysis rate of M2 was at least ten times higher than that of ENT and d3-ENT in rat plasma. ENT was mainly metabolized through the ""parent→M2→M1"" pathway based on in vitro and in vivo elimination behavior. The observed in vitro deuterium isotope effect translated into increased exposure of the deuterated analog in rats. Once the carbon-hydrogen was replaced with carbon-deuterium (C-D) bonds, the major metabolic pathway was retarded because of the relatively stable C-D bonds. The systemic exposure to d3-ENT can increase in humans, so the dose requirements can be reduced appropriately.",E3
26827258,2016,Diving Into Cabazitaxel's Mode of Action: More Than a Taxane for the Treatment of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.,"Prostate cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and mechanisms of action of taxanes and potential mechanisms of resistance are not clearly defined. Taxanes are microtubule-stabilizing agents resulting in the slowing or blocking of mitosis at the metaphase-anaphase transition and induction of apoptotic cell death. Taxanes also can inhibit androgen receptor pathway. To date, several factors have been associated with taxane resistance, including alterations in tubulin, the effect of drug efflux pumps, and the dysfunctional regulation of signaling pathways that may be involved in resistance to therapy. Preclinical and clinical data support the distinct activity of cabazitaxel in prostate cancer that may overcome resistance to prior taxanes or hormonal therapies. It is challenging to define the most adequate therapeutic sequence for each patient. Moreover, the identification of molecular markers of resistance may help to select patients for specific therapies.",C2

The disease is androgen driven and the use of orchiectomy or chemical castration, known as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been employed for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer for over 70 years. Agents such as GnRH agonists and non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonists are routinely used in the clinic, but eventually relapse occurs due to the emergence of castration-resistant prostate cancer. With the appreciation that androgen signaling still persists in these patients and the development of new therapies such as abiraterone and enzalutamide that further suppresses androgen synthesis or signaling, there is a renewed need for sensitive and specific methods to quantify androgen precursor and metabolite levels to assess drug efficacy. We describe the development, validation and application of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography electrospray ionization selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SID-LC/ESI/SRM/MS) method for quantification of serum keto-androgens and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates using Girard-T oxime derivatives. The method is robust down to 0.2-4pg on column, depending on the androgen metabolite quantified, and can also quantify dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) in only 1μL of serum. The clinical utility of this method was demonstrated by analyzing serum androgens from patients enrolled in a clinical trial assessing combinations of pharmacological agents to maximally suppress gonadal and adrenal androgens (Targeted Androgen Pathway Suppression, TAPS clinical trial).

Consequently, there is an urgent need for practical biomarkers to guide therapy selection and elucidate resistance. Although tissue biopsies are impractical to perform routinely in the majority of patients with mCRPC, the analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has recently emerged as a minimally invasive method to explore tumor characteristics. To reveal genomic characteristics from cfDNA associated with clinical outcomes during enzalutamide treatment. Plasma samples were obtained from August 4, 2013, to July 31, 2015, at a single academic institution (British Columbia Cancer Agency) from 65 patients with mCRPC. We collected temporal plasma samples (at baseline, 12 weeks, end of treatment) for circulating cfDNA and performed array comparative genomic hybridization copy number profiling and deep AR gene sequencing. Samples collected at end of treatment were also subjected to targeted sequencing of 19 prostate cancer-associated genes. Enzalutamide, 160 mg, daily orally. Prostate-specific antigen response rate (decline ≥50% from baseline confirmed ≥3 weeks later). Radiographic (as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 Criteria) and/or clinical progression (defined as worsening disease-related symptoms necessitating a change in anticancer therapy and/or deterioration in Eastern Cooperative Group performance status ≥2 levels). The 65 patients had a median (interquartile range) age of 74 (68-79) years. Prostate-specific antigen response rate to enzalutamide treatment was 38% (25 of 65), while median clinical/radiographic progression-free survival was 3.5 (95% CI, 2.1-5.0) months. Cell-free DNA was isolated from 122 of 125 plasma samples, and targeted sequencing was successful in 119 of 122. AR mutations and/or copy number alterations were robustly detected in 48% (31 of 65) and 60% (18 of 30) of baseline and progression samples, respectively. Detection of AR amplification, heavily mutated AR (≥2 mutations), and RB1 loss were associated with worse progression-free survival, with hazard ratios of 2.92 (95% CI, 1.59-5.37), 3.94 (95% CI, 1.46-10.64), and 4.46 (95% CI, 2.28-8.74), respectively. AR mutations exhibited clonal selection during treatment, including an increase in glucocorticoid-sensitive AR L702H and promiscuous AR T878A in patients with prior abiraterone treatment. At the time of progression, cfDNA sequencing revealed mutations or copy number changes in all patients tested, including clinically actionable alterations in DNA damage repair genes and PI3K pathway genes, and a high frequency (4 of 14) of activating CTNNB1 mutations. Clinically informative genomic profiling of cfDNA was feasible in nearly all patients with mCRPC and can provide important insights into enzalutamide response and resistance.",E3
22322981,2012,Novel strategies in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (Review).,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in Europe and the United States, and the third leading cause of death from cancer in Europe. Survival of prostate cancer cells is dependent on the activation of androgen receptors (AR), that are overexpressed in this tumor. Furthermore, ~90% of prostate cancer patients that respond to first-line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) undergo rapid progression. This condition is defined as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Docetaxel-based regimens significantly improve overall survival (OS) in patients with CRPC and represent the only treatment strategy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recently, abiraterone (second hormonal therapy) and cabazitaxel (new taxane) have been shown to improve survival in patients with CRPC who progressed following docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Vaccine therapy has also been demonstrated to improve OS in patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC. Additional therapeutic targets have been analyzed in prostate cancer, including apoptosis, angiogenic receptors, vitamin D and Src pathways. Several phase II studies are ongoing. The high frequency of prostate cancer-related metastatic bone disease has led to consider this pathway as a therapeutic target. To this end, several bone-targeted agents have been investigated, most notably zoledronic acid, which is highly effective at stabilizing the bone and preventing skeletal complications. More recently, a nuclear factor-β ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, denosumab, has been developed for the treatment of bone metastases.",C2
25743206,2015,Sequencing of Cabazitaxel and Abiraterone Acetate After Docetaxel in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes in Multicenter Community-Based US Oncology Practices.,"Optimal sequencing of cabazitaxel (C) and abiraterone acetate (A) after docetaxel (D) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is unclear. We assessed treatment patterns and outcomes in patients with mCRPC receiving different sequences of A or C, or both, after administration of D. Retrospective analysis was conducted of US Oncology Network iKnowMed (iKM) electronic health record (EHR) data to assess patients with mCRPC who received treatment with D and were subsequently treated with C or A, or both, between April 2011 and May 2012. Patients received 2 or 3 drugs: DA, DC, DAC, or DCA. Overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method from the start to the end of second-line therapy after administration of D (TTF1) and to the end of combined second- and third-line therapy (TTF2) for 3-drug sequences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models evaluated the impact of baseline clinical prognostic factors and treatment sequence on OS and TTF. Of 350 patients who were treated with D and subsequent therapies, 183 (52.3%) received DA, 54 (15.4%) received DC, 77 (22.0%) received DCA, and 36 (10.3%) received DAC. In a multivariable analysis, adjusted comparisons suggested that 3-drug sequences were associated with improved OS versus 2-drug sequences (hazard ratio [HR], 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.092-0.476; P = .0002). There were no statistically significant differences in OS and TTF for DC versus DA, and OS was significantly greater for DCA versus DAC (HR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.022-0.733; P = .0210). More cycles of C were administered in DCA than in DAC (median 6 vs. 4; t test P < .0001), whereas the duration of A treatment was similar. Administration of 3 agents in the DCA sequence was more optimal for treating mCRPC in this hypothesis-generating study.",C2

26157768,2015,Importance of cycles of chemotherapy and postdocetaxel novel therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"With the emergence of various novel therapies including new generation taxane and androgen-targeted therapies, the optimal sequence of systemic treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients remains to be defined. Our aim is to investigate the impact of duration of docetaxel-based chemotherapy and postdocetaxel treatment in mCRPC patients. The medical data of 57 Chinese mCRPC patients who received docetaxel-based chemotherapy in two oncology centers between 2003 and 2012 were reviewed. The treatment efficacy and toxicity were determined. The potential determinants of efficacy were also determined. Fifty-seven patients (median age 66 years, range 51-82 years) were given docetaxel-based chemotherapy, of whom 48 (84.2%) received 3-weekly docetaxel (52.5-75 mg/m(2)) and nine (15.8%) received weekly docetaxel (35 mg/m(2)). Postdocetaxel treatments were received by 31 (57.4%) patients, including abiraterone in 13 patients and cabazitaxel in one patient. The median follow-up time was 14.3 months. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were 20.8 months and 5.8 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, eight cycles or more of chemotherapy [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.151, P < 0.0358], use of postdocetaxel treatment (HR = 0.346, P = 0.0005), and hemoglobin level of <10 (HR = 5.224, P < 0.0001) were independent determinants of OS. Patients who had received abiraterone and cabazitaxel as postdocetaxel treatment had significantly longer OS compared with those who received other postdocetaxel treatments (including rechallenge of docetaxel) and those who did not receive any postdocetaxel treatment (35.3 months vs. 20.8 months vs. 15.3 months, P = 0.00057). The results suggest that maximizing exposure to docetaxel-based chemotherapy followed by novel therapies would have a favorable survival impact on mCRPC patients.",C2
25224448,2014,Emerging mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.,"The majority of prostate cancers are hormone-dependent at diagnosis highlighting the central role of androgen signalling in this disease. Surprisingly, most forms of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are still dependent on the androgen receptor (AR) for survival. Therefore, the advent of new AR-targeting drugs, such as enzalutamide, is certainly beneficial for the many patients with metastatic CRPC. Indeed, this compound provides a substantial survival benefit-but it is not curative. This Perspectives article describes the different ways through which cancer cells can become resistant to enzalutamide, such as AR truncation and other mutations, as well as by-pass of the AR dependence of prostate cancer cells through expression of the glucocorticoid receptor. The clinical relevance of these mechanisms and emerging questions concerning new therapeutic regimens in the treatment of metastatic CRPC are being discussed.",E3
25053178,2014,Clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after abiraterone.,"The optimal sequencing of the multiple active agents now available for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is unclear. Prior reports have suggested diminished responses to sequential lines of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies, but it is unknown whether subsequent taxane-based chemotherapy may be more effective than sequential AR-targeting treatment. We sought to evaluate the clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with mCRPC who progressed on abiraterone. We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis of consecutive mCRPC patients who had progressed on abiraterone therapy and subsequently received either enzalutamide (n=30) or docetaxel (n=31). We evaluated clinical outcomes including prostate-specific antigen decline of >30% (PSA30) or >50% (PSA50), PSA-progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and clinical/radiographic PFS. We performed multivariable modeling to control for baseline and on-treatment differences between groups. Compared to subjects who received enzalutamide post-abiraterone, subjects who received docetaxel post-abiraterone had more bone metastases, more visceral metastases, higher baseline PSA, and had more frequent PSA tests while on-treatment. There were no significant differences in PSA30 (41% for enzalutamide vs. 53% for docetaxel) or PSA50 (34% vs. 40%) response rates between the two groups; there remained no difference after stratifying by presence/absence of prior response to abiraterone. Median PSA-PFS was 4.1 versus 4.1 months for the enzalutamide and docetaxel cohorts, respectively (HR 1.35, 95% CI, 0.53-3.66, P=0.502). Median PFS was 4.7 versus 4.4 months, respectively (HR 1.44, 95% CI, 0.77-2.71, P=0.257). PSA-PFS and PFS did not differ after stratifying by prior response to abiraterone. In multivariable analyses, there were no significant differences in PSA-PFS or PFS between the two groups. Treatment with either enzalutamide or docetaxel produced modest PSA responses and PFS intervals in this abiraterone-pretreated mCRPC population. In this retrospective study with small sample size, no significant differences in outcomes were observed between groups. Therefore, either enzalutamide or docetaxel may be a reasonable option in men who have progressed on abiraterone.",A1
23811702,2013,Sequencing systemic therapies in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Men with prostate cancer will not die of the disease until it progresses to the metastatic castration resistant stage. At that stage, the median survival is 9 to 30 months. Recently approved and emerging treatments for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were reviewed based on their mechanisms of action, as well as sequencing and combining these treatments with existing options. Advances in androgen deprivation therapy, immunotherapy, bone-targeted therapy, and chemotherapy have led to approvals of abiraterone acetate, sipuleucel-T, denosumab, and cabazitaxel for the treatment of mCRPC. Despite improvements in patient survival and quality of life, mCRPC remains incurable. With the emerging new therapies, this is an unprecedented time in treating mCRPC. A better understanding of their mechanisms of action, the genetic makeup of each mCRPC, and the development of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers will help determine sequencing or different combination treatments for each individual patient.",C2
26645563,2016,Multinucleation and Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition Alleviate Resistance to Combined Cabazitaxel and Antiandrogen Therapy in Advanced Prostate Cancer.,"Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) frequently develop therapeutic resistance to taxane chemotherapy and antiandrogens. Cabazitaxel is a second-line taxane chemotherapeutic agent that provides additional survival benefits to patients with advanced disease. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanism of action of combined cabazitaxel and androgen receptor (AR) targeting in preclinical models of advanced prostate cancer. We found that cabazitaxel induced mitotic spindle collapse and multinucleation by targeting the microtubule depolymerizing kinesins and inhibiting AR. In androgen-responsive tumors, treatment with the AR inhibitor, enzalutamide, overcame resistance to cabazitaxel. Combination treatment of human CRPC xenografts with cabazitaxel and enzalutamide reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and led to multinucleation, while retaining nuclear AR. In a transgenic mouse model of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, cabazitaxel treatment induced MET, glandular redifferentiation, and AR nuclear localization that was inhibited by androgen deprivation. Collectively, our preclinical studies demonstrate that prostate tumor resistance to cabazitaxel can be overcome by antiandrogen-mediated EMT-MET cycling in androgen-sensitive tumors but not in CRPC. Moreover, AR splice variants may preclude patients with advanced disease from responding to cabazitaxel chemotherapy and antiandrogen combination therapy. This evidence enables a significant insight into therapeutic cross-resistance to taxane chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.",C2

Four new agents (cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and radium-233) have been shown to prolong overall survival in patients with CRPC in the postchemotherapy setting. Targeting the androgen receptor pathway continues to have an important role in the treatment of CRPC, with abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide being the most exciting developments. Cabazitaxel is now considered the standard-of-care second-line chemotherapy for men with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC). Bone-targeted therapy is an active area of research, with denosumab being the first bone-targeted agent able to significantly delay the appearance of bone metastases in patients with CRPC and radium-223 being the first radiopharmaceutical agent to improve survival in patients with mCRPC.",C2

Before reimbursement was available, cabazitaxel was provided through a Compassionate Use Program (CUP). We report the results of the Dutch CUP, detailing the safety and efficacy of cabazitaxel in a routine clinical practice setting. Safety and efficacy data of all 5 Dutch centers participating in the cabazitaxel CUP were collected. Safety data were collected prospectively using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), time to PSA progression (TTPP), and best clinical response were evaluated retrospectively. Fifty-one patients were registered in the CUP; 49 received cabazitaxel. Forty-two of 49 patients [85.7%], 42 patients had ≥ 2 metastatic sites. Patients received on average 6 cabazitaxel cycles (range, 1-21). A dose reduction or dose delay occurred in 13 and 20 patients [26.5% and 40.9%] respectively. Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used in 8 patients [16.3%]. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were observed in 25 patients [51.0%]; 16 patients [32.7%] discontinued treatment because of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 16 (32.7%) patients; the most frequent SAEs were hematuria (4 patients [8.3%]) and urosepsis (3 patients [6.3%]). Febrile neutropenia occurred twice; no patient had grade ≥ 3 neuropathy. No toxicity-related mortality occurred. Median follow-up was 24.1 months. Median OS was 8.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 6.0-15.9 months); median TTPP was 2.8 months (IQR, 1.7-5.9 months). In the Dutch CUP, patients with advanced mCRPC had delayed tumor progression with acceptable toxicities using cabazitaxel treatment.",C2

In separate phase III studies, each agent led to an improvement in overall survival (OS) of 2-4 months over a suitable comparator. With these costly therapies all having potential application in the patient with mCRPC, multiple entities (industry, government, and the general public) must strategize to determine how the cost burden of these agents can be balanced with the potential gains for the individual patient.

26856599,2016,Role of taxanes in advanced prostate cancer.,"Advanced prostate cancer is an androgen-dependent disease for which the initial treatment is an androgen deprivation maneuver. However, some primary resistances to hormonal treatment occur with increasing incidence throughout the evolution of the disease. The taxanes, docetaxel and cabazitaxel, exert their action at multiple levels at the tumor cell: besides inhibiting the mitosis and inducing the cell death, they induce the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, a potent nuclear factor that acts against the activation of androgen receptor inhibiting the transcription of AR-V7 variant associated with the development of resistances to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Docetaxel, as first-line therapy, and cabazitaxel, as second-line therapy, have demonstrated to increase the survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The results from last studies either on high-risk localized disease or on androgen-sensitive tumors demonstrate the increasing role of taxanes at earlier states of prostate cancer.",A1
26468445,2015,Is there still a place for docetaxel rechallenge in prostate cancer?,"Three-weekly docetaxel plus prednisone is the standard first-line cytotoxic treatment for patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Today, several new treatment options are available for patients with tumor progression after first-line docetaxel: Abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T immunotherapy, and the radionuclide radium-223. However, despite the evolving scenario in CRPC treatment, the optimal sequencing of the innovative therapies remains unclear. The reintroduction of docetaxel at the occurrence of disease progression after a drug holiday (docetaxel rechallenge) was often proposed, and this chemotherapeutic agent showed to maintain antitumor activity in mCRPC patients. Docetaxel rechallenge may still constitute a valid treatment option mainly for patients with favorable response to first-line docetaxel, at least > 3 mo progression-free interval, age less than 75 years, good performance status, and acceptable docetaxel toxicity. The risk of cumulative toxicity must be evaluated, since sensory neuropathy, nail disorders and fatigue might occur on docetaxel rechallenge.",C2
26196517,2015,Identification of Androgen Receptor Splice Variants in the Pten Deficient Murine Prostate Cancer Model.,"Androgen receptor (AR) variants are associated with resistance to anti androgen therapy both in human prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples. These observations support the hypothesis that AR isoform accumulation is a consequence of selective therapeutic pressure on the full length AR. The Pten deficient prostate cancer model proceeds with well-defined kinetics including progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). While surgical castration and enzalutamide treatments yield an initial therapeutic response, Pten-/-epithelia continue to proliferate yielding locally invasive primary tumor pathology. That most epithelium remains AR positive, but ligand independent, suggests the presence of oncogenic AR variants. To address this hypothesis, we have used a panel of recently described Pten-/- tumor cell lines derived from both from hormone intact (E4, E8) and castrated Pten mutants (cE1, cE2) followed by RACE PCR to identify and characterize three novel truncated, amino terminus containing AR variants (mAR-Va, b, c). Variants appear not only conserved throughout progression but are correlated with nearly complete loss of full length AR (AR-FL) at castrate androgen levels. The overexpression of variants leads to enhanced transcriptional activity of AR while knock down studies show reduced transcriptional output. Collectively, the identification of truncated AR variants in the conditional PTEN deletion model supports a role for maintaining the CRPC phenotype and provides further therapeutic applications of this preclinical model.",E3
24508512,2014,A-ring modified steroidal azoles retaining similar potent and slowly reversible CYP17A1 inhibition as abiraterone.,"Abiraterone acetate is a potent inhibitor of human cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17A1, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) and is clinically used in combination with prednisone for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although many studies have documented the potency of abiraterone (Abi) in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems for several species, the exact potency of Abi for human CYP17A1 enzyme has not yet been determined, and the structural requirements for high-potency steroidal azole inhibitors are not established. We synthesized 4 Abi analogs differing in the A-B ring substitution patterns: 3α-hydroxy-Δ(4)-Abi (13), 3-keto-Δ(4)-Abi (11), 3-keto-5α-Abi (6), and 3α-hydroxy-5α-Abi (5). We measured the spectral binding constants (Ks) using purified and modified human CYP17A1 along with the determination constants (Ki) applying a native human CYP17A1 enzyme in yeast microsomes for these compounds as well as for ketoconazole. For Abi, 3-keto-Δ(4)-Abi, 3-keto-5α-Abi, and 3α-hydroxy-5α-Abi, the type 2 spectral changes gave the best fit for a quadratic equation, since in these experiments Ks values were 0.1-2.6nM, much lower than that for ketoconazole and 3α-hydroxy-Δ(4)-Abi (Ks values were 140 and 1660nM, respectively). Inhibition experiments showed mixed inhibition patterns with Ki values of 7-80nM. Abi dissociation from the CYP17A1-Abi complex was incomplete and slow; the t1/2 for dissociation was 1.8h, with 55% of complex remaining after 5h. We conclude that Abi and the 3 related steroidal azoles (3-keto-Δ(4)-Abi, 3-keto-5α-Abi, and 3α-hydroxy-5α-Abi), which also mimic natural substrates, are extraordinarily potent inhibitors of human CYP17A1, whereas the 3α-hydroxy-Δ(4)-Abi is moderately potent and comparable to ketoconazole.",A1
28125362,2017,Duration of Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide.,"Abiraterone acetate (AA) and enzalutamide (ENZ) are oral therapies offering survival benefit to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Despite the availability of multiple treatment options for mCRPC, there is a lack of information on the effect that being initiated on AA or ENZ has on the combined prostate cancer treatment duration. To compare the combined duration of prostate cancer treatments of patients initiated on AA with that of patients initiated on ENZ. Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases from March 2012 to December 2014 were used to identify males with prostate cancer initiated on AA or ENZ (index therapy). Baseline characteristics were assessed during the 6 months pre-index. Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) were used to reduce baseline confounding. Treatment duration spanned from the index date to the earliest of treatment discontinuation (defined as a > 60-day gap in treatment), 24 months post-index, health plan disenrollment, or end of data. Weighted Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the combined duration of mCRPC treatments (AA, ENZ, chemotherapy, sipuleucel-T, and radium 223) and any prostate cancer treatments (mCRPC, hormonal, and corticosteroid treatments) between patients initiated on either AA or ENZ. A total of 2,591 patients initiated on AA and 807 patients initiated on ENZ were selected for the study. Patients' characteristics were generally well balanced after IPTW. At 3 months, patients initiated on AA were associated with fewer discontinuations of mCRPC treatments (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, P = 0.004) or of any prostate cancer treatments (HR = 0.61, P = 0.002), compared with patients initiated on ENZ. This result was maintained at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months for mCRPC treatments (HR = 0.75, P < 0.001) and for any prostate cancer treatments (HR = 0.69, P < 0.001). Median duration of mCRPC treatments was 4.1 months longer for patients initiated on AA compared with those initiated on ENZ (18.3 vs. 14.2 months, P < 0.001) and similarly, the median duration of any prostate cancer treatment was longer for patients initiated on AA compared with those initiated on ENZ (not reached vs. 22.2 months, P < 0.001). In this study, patients initiated on AA, compared with those initiated on ENZ, had a longer combined duration of mCRPC or prostate cancer treatments.

We retrospectively identified 30 consecutive patients with metastatic prostate cancer who were treated with enzalutamide after docetaxel. Post-discontinuation PSA results were available for all patients and were determined at 2-weekly intervals until starting further anticancer systemic therapy. PSA withdrawal response was defined as a PSA decline by ≥50% from the last on-treatment PSA, with a confirmed decrease ≥3 weeks later. Patient characteristics were evaluated in relation to the AAWS using univariate logistic regression analysis. The median (range) patient age was 70.5 (56-86) years and the median (range) follow-up was 9.0 (0.5-16) months. The most common metastatic sites were the bone (86.7%) and lymph nodes (66.7%). Most patients (70%) had previously received abiraterone and 12 patients (40%) had also received cabazitaxel. The median (range) treatment duration with enzalutamide was 3.68 (1.12-21.39) months. PSA levels after enzalutamide withdrawal were monitored for a median (range) time of 35 (10-120) days. Only one patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response ≥50% after enzalutamide discontinuation. One patient (3.3%) had a confirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50% and another patient (3.3%) had an unconfirmed PSA response of between 30 and 50%. The median overall survival was 15.5 months (95% CI 8.1-24.7). None of the factors analysed in the univariate analysis were significant predictors of PSA decline after enzalutamide discontinuation. This retrospective study provides the first evidence that enzalutamide may have an AAWS in a minority of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm the existence of an enzalutamide AAWS and to assess its relevance in prostate cancer management.",C2
27754846,2016,Advances in the management of castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Docetaxel based chemotherapy showed survival benefit and emerged as the mainstay of treatment for castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in 2004. However, therapeutic options have expanded rapidly since 2011. The spectrum of new agents is broad and includes drugs that target the androgen axis (enzalutamide, abiraterone), immunotherapy (sipuleucel-T), bone seeking radionuclides (radium-223), and second line chemotherapy (cabazitaxel). In addition, new agents have been developed to reduce skeletal related events (denosumab). Given that docetaxel was the standard first line treatment for metastatic CRPC, the newer oral agents that affect the androgen axis were initially approved in the post-docetaxel setting. However, subsequent randomized trials have led to their approval in the pre-chemotherapy setting as well. Patients with CRPC are clinically heterogeneous, ranging from patients who are asymptomatic and do not have metastases to those with substantial symptoms and both bony and visceral metastases. CRPC is a clinically challenging disease entity, therefore, with a wide array of treatment options and multiple possible sequencing combinations depending on the individual patient. This review will summarize the findings of the randomized trials that led to the approval of the therapies for CRPC. It will also discuss recent guidelines and provide suggestions for sequencing of drugs based on the best available evidence.",C2

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel plus prednisone with those of mitoxantrone plus prednisone in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with progressive disease after docetaxel-based treatment. We undertook an open-label randomised phase 3 trial in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had received previous hormone therapy, but whose disease had progressed during or after treatment with a docetaxel-containing regimen. Participants were treated with 10 mg oral prednisone daily, and were randomly assigned to receive either 12 mg/m(2) mitoxantrone intravenously over 15-30 min or 25 mg/m(2) cabazitaxel intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The random allocation schedule was computer-generated; patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment allocation, but the study team was masked to the data analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and safety. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00417079. 755 men were allocated to treatment groups (377 mitoxantrone, 378 cabazitaxel) and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At the cutoff for the final analysis (Sept 25, 2009), median survival was 15·1 months (95% CI 14·1-16·3) in the cabazitaxel group and 12·7 months (11·6-13·7) in the mitoxantrone group. The hazard ratio for death of men treated with cabazitaxel compared with those taking mitoxantrone was 0·70 (95% CI 0·59-0·83, p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·4-3·0) in the cabazitaxel group and 1·4 months (1·4-1·7) in the mitoxantrone group (HR 0·74, 0·64-0·86, p<0·0001). The most common clinically significant grade 3 or higher adverse events were neutropenia (cabazitaxel, 303 [82%] patients vs mitoxantrone, 215 [58%]) and diarrhoea (23 [6%] vs one [<1%]). 28 (8%) patients in the cabazitaxel group and five (1%) in the mitoxantrone group had febrile neutropenia. Treatment with cabazitaxel plus prednisone has important clinical antitumour activity, improving overall survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer whose disease has progressed during or after docetaxel-based therapy.

23650874,2014,Role of immunotherapy in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).,"Initial therapy for metastatic prostate cancer consists of androgenic suppression. However, this is only a palliative treatment with an effective duration that usually lasts 12-24 months. Historically, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) had been considered a chemoresistant tumour. In 2004, docetaxel received USA Food and Drug Administration approval as a first-line treatment for metastatic prostate cancer, after two independent phase III trials showed an increased survival benefit. Recently, five new drugs have shown increased survival in CRPC: sipuleucel-T (assymptomatic or minimally symptomatic), abiraterone acetate (before and after docetaxel), cabazitaxel (after docetaxel), MDV3100 (after docetaxel) and radium-223 (not suitable for docetaxel or after docetaxel). The identification of antigens in normal prostate tissue or prostate cancer that are recognised by immune effectors cells has resulted in several new studies based on immunotherapy. Prostate cancer disease provides a test system to determine the efficacy of vaccines for different reasons. This cancer is a tumour that grows relatively slowly. Recurrence is often diagnosed early (with many patients presenting only with biochemical progression), there is a biological marker that can predict prognosis and outcome (PSA doubling time), various specific antigens have been identified and characterised, and vaccines can be used with a good safety profile combined with anti-androgen therapy, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. Here we provide a review of the main important immune treatments in CRPC.",C2

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the core treatment of advance-staged disease since the discovery of prostate cancer's androgen dependence in 1941 by Huggins et al. [1] Options for initial medical treatment include gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues such as leuprolide (LHRH agonist) and degarelix (LHRH antagonist) and androgen receptor (AR) binding agents such as bicalutamide. Although most patients will initially respond to either surgical or medical castration, there is almost always progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) necessitating treatment with more novel agents.

Within the past 2 years, 5 agents have been approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC (cabazitaxel, abiraterone, sipuleucel-T, denosumab, and enzalutamide), and another (Alpharadin) has shown overall survival benefit in a phase III trial. This article summarizes the phase III data showing clinical benefit from these agents, highlights other promising therapies in phase III studies as single agents (PROSTVAC-VF, ipilimumab, cabozantinib), discusses important unanswered questions regarding these therapies, and provides a schema for their use based on current regulatory approval and how this is likely to evolve as data from ongoing studies are reported.

After prostate cancer treatment failure: 4-month survival advantage.,"There is no standard treatment for metastatic prostate cancer that progresses despite castration and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Abiraterone inhibits both testicular and extratesticular androgen synthesis. It has been approved in the European Union for use in this situation, in which treatment options are extremely limited. Clinical evaluation is based on a double-blind comparative trial of good methodological quality that included 1195 patients. The median overall survival time was 4 months longer in the group treated with abiraterone + prednisone (or prednisolone) than in the group treated with placebo + prednisone (or prednisolone): 15.8 versus 11.2 months. The addition of prednisone (or prednisolone) reduced but did not eliminate the effects of hyperaldosteronism induced by abiraterone; oedema occurred in 26.7% of patients, arterial hypertension in 8.5%, and hypokalaemia in 17.1%. Moderate hepatotoxicity was reported with abiraterone and needs to be better assessed. Abiraterone was also associated with cardiac arrhythmias (7.2% versus 4.6% with placebo) and heart failure (1% versus 0.3%). Abiraterone is metabolised by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 and inhibits isoenzyme CYP2D6, resulting in a high potential for drug interactions. Treatment is somewhat inconvenient. Abiraterone must be taken between meals, serum potassium levels must be monitored, and care must be taken to avoid interactions. Overall, the known risks of abiraterone appear to be acceptable in view of its efficacy, but patients must be carefully monitored. Abiraterone is one option to discuss with patients with metastatic prostate cancer after other treatments fail.",A1

We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day. The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

27157640,2016,The Effect of Time to Castration Resistance on Outcomes With Abiraterone and Enzalutamide in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.,"Abiraterone and enzalutamide are 2 novel androgen receptor (AR)-targeting therapies that improve survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The factors that predict abiraterone and enzalutamide response are lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine whether the outcomes from primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could predict the outcomes with subsequent novel AR-targeting therapies. We identified 80 consecutive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationships between the primary ADT response and the primary outcome of progression-free survival (PFS) after initiating novel hormonal therapy. The secondary outcomes included prostate-specific antigen decline and overall survival. The survival probabilities were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences assessed with the log-rank test. The time to castration resistance with primary ADT showed a significant association with both PFS and overall survival after initiating novel hormone therapy (P = .032 and P = .028, respectively). Patients with progression during primary ADT before 1 year had a median PFS of 3.4 months compared with a median PFS of 7.6 and 8.1 months for patients whose time to castration resistance was ≥ 1 and ≤ 5 years (P = .008) and > 5 years (P = .026), respectively. However, the time to castration resistance was not an independent predictor of survival or the PSA response with novel AR-targeting therapy on multivariate analysis. A rapid time to progression during primary ADT was associated with poor outcomes but was not an independent predictor of the response to enzalutamide or abiraterone.",A1

In this retrospective observational study, we reviewed the course of disease of all applicable patients with mCRPC treated with docetaxel followed by abiraterone at our center. We analyzed progression-free survival (PFS) of docetaxel and abiraterone treatments. We further searched for predictive factors for the duration of treatment response. Median PFS between initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and the diagnosis of mCRPC was 32 months. Median PFS on docetaxel treatment was 9 months. Median PFS on abiraterone treatment was 11 months. Patients with higher Gleason scores (GS) (8-10) at initial diagnosis had a significantly longer median PFS on docetaxel as compared to patients with GS 6-7, p = 0.01. We demonstrate a significant correlation between the PFS on docetaxel and PFS on abiraterone in the post-docetaxel setting (Kendall tau r = 0.32, p = 0.019) as well as a significant negative correlation between the PSA nadir under abiraterone treatment and the time to progression under abiraterone (Kendall tau r = -0.43, p = 0.007). High Gleason score appears to be predictive of duration of response to docetaxel. Interestingly, progression-free survival with abiraterone appears to be correlated with the duration of response with docetaxel, whereas PSA decline and low nadir appear to be predictive of response to abiraterone.",A1
21426013,2011,"Novel, potent anti-androgens of therapeutic potential: recent advances and promising developments.","The beneficial effect of androgen ablation has been well established in prostate cancer therapy. Despite the initial response, patients typically relapse with a more aggressive form described as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRCP), driven by continued androgen receptor (AR) signaling. This review details the current state of anti-androgen therapy, mainly for CRPC, with major emphasis on the most potent and promising compounds under development. Anti-androgen failure has been linked to elevated AR expression, increased expression of coactivator proteins, AR mutations, ligand-independent AR activation and persistent intraprostatic androgens. MDV3100, BMS-641988 and VN/124-1 were developed to overcome these mechanisms. In CRCP, prostate cancer cells still rely on intracellular androgens and, to a greater extent, on active AR for growth and survival. Therefore, potent anti-androgens that efficiently disrupt the functions (signaling) of AR are envisioned to be effective drugs for all types of prostate cancers.",E3
24352647,2014,Inhibition of protein kinase C/Twist1 signaling augments anticancer effects of androgen deprivation and enzalutamide in prostate cancer.,"The progression of prostate cancer to metastatic and castration-resistant disease represents a critical step. We previously showed that the transcription factor Twist1, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, was involved in castration-resistant progression. Similarly, protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in both metastatic progression and castration resistance in prostate cancer. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of PKC/Twist1 signaling in castration resistance, and to apply this information to the development of a novel therapeutic concept using PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 against prostate cancer using various prostate cancer cell lines. Androgen deprivation and the next-generation antiandrogen enzalutamide induced PKC activation and Twist1 expression, which were reversed by the PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220. Ro31-8220 suppressed cell proliferation in androgen-dependent prostate cancer LNCaP cells, which was augmented by its combination with androgen deprivation or enzalutamide. The favorable anticancer effects of the combination of Ro31-8220 and enzalutamide were also observed in castration-resistant C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, PKC phosphorylation was elevated in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells compared with their parental cells, leading to persistent sensitivity to Ro-31-8220 in castration- and enzalutamide-resistant cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that PKC/Twist1 signaling contributes to castration resistance as well as enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer, and suggest that therapeutics targeting PKC/Twist1 signaling, such as PKC inhibitors, represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer, especially castration-resistant prostate cancer, when combined with enzalutamide.",E3
23362491,2013,Enzalutamide for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a major clinical challenge, given the mechanistic heterogeneity due to a complex signal transduction network. Enzalutamide (MDV-3100), recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at a dose of 160 mg/day for the treatment of CRPC, blocks androgen signaling by directly binding to the androgen receptor (AR) and inhibiting nuclear translocation and coactivator recruitment of the ligand-receptor complex. In preclinical studies, enzalutamide has been shown to block the binding of AR to DNA, resulting in apoptosis and retardation of tumor growth. Clinically, a phase I/II study (N = 140) revealed that enzalutamide had an optimal safety profile and significant antitumor activity in patients with CRPC regardless of prior chemotherapy. In the AFFIRM phase III trial (N = 1,199), oral enzalutamide significantly improved survival in men with metastatic CRPC after chemotherapy. Currently, a phase III trial (PREVAIL) is under way to determine the effectiveness of enzalutamide in patients who have not received prior docetaxel chemotherapy.",E3
26894509,2016,Targeting fatty acid synthase with ASC-J9 suppresses proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells.,"Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the key enzyme for the control of fatty acid synthesis that contributes significantly to the prostate cancer (PCa) progression. It was reported that androgens were able to induce FASN expression in PCa, and addition of the anti-androgen Casodex might suppress the androgen-induced FASN expression. However, here we found androgen-deprivation-therapy (ADT) with anti-androgens Bicalutamide (Casodex) or Enzalutamide (MDV3100) had little effect to suppress FASN expression and FASN-mediated cell growth and invasion during the castration resistant stage when the androgen concentration is 1 nM DHT (dihydrotestosterone). In contrast, the newly developed androgen receptor (AR) degradation enhancer ASC-J9(®) suppressed FASN expression and FASN-mediated cell growth and invasion in various PCa cell lines at 1 nM DHT. Mechanism dissection found ASC-J9(®) could suppress significantly the FASN expression and FASN-mediated PCa progression via the AR-dependent pathway involving AR→SREBP-1→FASN signaling in AR-positive C4-2 and LNCaP cells and via the AR-independent pathway involving the modulation of PI3K/AKT→SREBP-1→FASN signaling in AR-negative PC-3 and DU145 cells. Together, these results suggest that FASN is one of the important mechanism why the current ADT eventually fails. ASC-J9(®) might represent a new potential therapeutic approach to suppress FASN-mediated PCa progression via both AR-dependent and AR-independent pathways during the castration resistant stage of PCa. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",E3

In some cases, the tumor progresses despite castration levels of serum testosterone, turning into the lethal phenotype of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), still driven by androgens and requiring the androgen receptor as a driver and responsible for progression. Enzalutamide, an androgen receptor inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of metastatic CRPC, asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, after failure of androgen deprivation. In both clinical trials that led to its approval, Enzalutamide was administered with an LHRH analog, setting the ""standard of care"" for its use. In this article we evaluate the available evidence and theory on the use of Enzalutamide as monotherapy. Androgen deprivation well-known adverse events, together with the fact that its clinical benefit is moderate and the evidence strength is weak, and the direct negative impact on the common chronic conditions affecting this age-group led to investigation of Enzalutamide without LHRH analogs. There are clinical trials on Enzalutamide monotherapy for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with favourable outcomes, and there are also two ongoing studies in different advanced PCa scenarios, the PROSPER and EMBARK trials. It would be up to now a safe alternative, with less toxicity and lower costs.

A decision-tree model compared three treatment options for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients over 18 months from a societal perspective in 2012 USD. Chance nodes included baseline pain as a severity indicator, significant adverse effects (neutropenia, cardiac events, or seizures), and survival. Probabilities, survival rates, and health utilities were from clinical trials (COU-AA, TROPIC, and AFFIRM) and other published studies. Survival of enzalutamide was adjusted to match placebo groups across trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, acceptability curves and net benefit calculations were performed. Abiraterone was the most cost-effective of the treatments ($123.4 K/quality-adjusted life year) compared to placebo, enzalutamide was $437.6 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to abiraterone, and cabazitaxel was $351.9 K/quality-adjusted life year compared to enzalutamide. Enzalutamide and cabazitaxel were not cost-effective compared to placebo at $154.3 K/quality-adjusted life year and $163.2 K/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Acceptability curves showed abiraterone was cost-effective 29.3% of the time with a willingness to pay threshold of $100 K. The model was sensitive to changes in cost of the drugs, life expectancy, and survival rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that enzalutamide can become the most cost-effective option if the price of the medication decreased by 26% and other drug costs remained the same. Based on the cost-effective analysis, and survival adjustments necessary to match placebo groups, we would recommend abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer despite not quite falling under the usually accepted willingness to pay threshold. Further analysis should examine comparative survival across the three drugs.",C2

One of the approaches to overcome it is combination therapy and from this point of view some potential for drug-drug interactions can limit the application of the drug. We describe here the preclinical development of ONC1-13B, antagonist of androgen receptor, with similar to MDV3100 and ARN-509 mechanism of action. It efficiently inhibits DHT-stimulated PSA expression and proliferation of prostate cancer cells, prevents binding of androgens to the AR ligand-binding domain, androgen-stimulated AR nuclear translocation and coactivator complex formation. In the LnCaP-Z2 xenograft model of prostate cancer ONC1-13B inhibits tumor growth and suppresses PSA expression. The in vivo activity of ONC1-13B is comparable to that of MDV3100 at similar doses, and even higher, calculated per unit of concentration in plasma. Distribution of ONC1-13B to the brain is less than that shown for MDV3100 and ARN-509, decreasing the risk of GABA-related seizure development. Additionally ONC1-13B induces significantly lower in vitro CYP3A activity than for example MDV3100 (known strong CYP3A inducer) or ARN-509 and could be well suited for co-therapy with drugs that are known CYP3A substrates. Thus ONC1-13B is a new promising antiandrogen demonstrating high efficacy in a preclinical model of prostate cancer, with lower potential for seizures and drug-drug interaction.",E3
24451751,2014,State-of-the-Art Management for the Patient with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in 2012.,"Much progress has been made in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and multiple new U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved survival-prolonging drugs are now available. In 2004, docetaxel/prednisone was the first therapy shown to prolong survival. In 2010 and 2011, sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel/prednisone, and abiraterone/prednisone were FDA approved. Two new agents, radium-223 and MDV-3100, have recently reported large phase III trials prolonging overall survival and will be submitted for regulatory approval in 2012. One can now begin to ask, is there an optimal sequence for therapies in metastatic CRPC? Despite the recent progress, there is much we do not know and virtually no information on this important question. We know that abiraterone/prednisone and cabazitaxel/prednisone are appropriate choices for a patient after receiving docetaxel, but we do not know what, if anything, represents the optimal sequence for abiraterone and cabazitaxel. In fact we do not understand how one therapy may affect the response to a subsequent therapy. We are also aware that the pre- and postdocetaxel spaces represent regulatory rather than biologic divisions. In addition, despite the proven role of docetaxel/prednisone, many patients with CRPC are not considered to be suitable for chemotherapy, and worldwide many never receive any form of chemotherapy. What is the optimal management for these patients? Taken together it is reasonable to assess patient preferences, prior therapies and response/tolerance to prior therapies, burden of disease, comorbidities, current symptoms, drug toxicities, out-of-pocket costs, etc., in clinical decision making. Given the many factors we do not know, it is hard to be dogmatic in approaching the therapeutic options for the patient with CRPC. We will likely soon move beyond the current sequencing paradigm and begin to assess new combinations in a systematic and rational fashion. Perhaps one day, in the not too distant future, we will develop molecular ""stratification systems"" to better guide therapeutic choices in CRPC.",C2

It is becoming increasingly understood that this disease entity continues to evolve over time, acquiring additional and diverse resistance mechanisms with each subsequent therapy used. This dynamic relationship between treatment pressure and disease resistance can be challenging for the managing clinician. The recent discovery of alternate splice variants of the androgen receptor (AR) is one potential mechanism of escape in mCRPC, and recognizing this resistance mechanism might be important for optimal treatment selection for our patients. AR-V7 appears to be the most relevant AR splice variant, and early clinical data suggest that it is a negative prognostic marker in mCRPC. Emerging evidence also suggests that detection of AR-V7 may be associated with resistance to novel hormonal therapy (abiraterone and enzalutamide) but may be compatible with sensitivity to taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel and cabazitaxel). Adding to this complexity is the observation that AR-V7 is a dynamic marker whose status may change across time and depending on selective pressures induced by different therapies. Finally, it is possible that AR-V7 may represent a therapeutic target in mCRPC if drugs can be designed that degrade or inhibit AR splice variants or block their transcriptional activity. Several such agents (including galeterone, EPI-506, and bromodomain/BET inhibitors) are now in clinical development.",C2

Recent data for cabazitaxel, a novel taxane chemotherapy, and abiraterone acetate, a novel inhibitor of androgen synthesis, demonstrate significant improvements in the survival of patients with docetaxel-refractory CRPC. We review the mechanisms of action of these agents and data from phase III clinical trials, contextualizing their place in therapy. We also update other areas of investigation, including oral platinum analogues, vascular-endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy, inhibitors of chaperone proteins, and androgen receptor antagonists. Upon disease progression after first-line docetaxel chemotherapy, cabazitaxel and abiraterone improve survival of patients with CRPC and are important novel treatment options. Potential toxicity from cabazitaxel necessitates careful patient selection and supportive care. Both abiraterone and cabazitaxel are also being evaluated in the first-line setting, and therefore the optimal sequencing of therapies remains uncertain. Many other novel agents continue to be evaluated and promising classes of agents include antisense oligonucleotides against clusterin (custirsen) and androgen receptor antagonists (MDV3100).",C2

26109877,2015,A profile of enzalutamide for the treatment of advanced castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of castration resistant prostate cancer from androgen-sensitive prostate cancer have provided new avenues exploring efficacious therapies in a disease which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the western world. In the evolution of second generation anti-androgens, enzalutamide, a novel androgen-receptor signaling inhibitor, has emerged targeting multiple steps within the androgenic stimulation pathway. This review discusses what is currently known of the mechanisms surrounding castration resistant prostate cancer development and the current human clinical trials to determine whether enzalutamide presents a new hope for men with advanced prostate cancer. The issues of therapy resistance, withdrawal effects and cross-resistance are briefly touched upon.",E3

27179779,2016,Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.,"It is believed that growth of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells is enabled by sensitization to minimal residual post-castrate androgen due to overexpression of the androgen receptor (AR). Evidence is derived from androgen-induced colony formation in the absence of cell-secreted factors or from studies involving forced AR overexpression in hormone-dependent cells. On the other hand, standard cell line models established from CRPC patient tumors (e.g., LNCaP and VCaP) are hormone-dependent and require selection pressure in castrated mice to re-emerge as CRPC cells and the resulting tumors then tend to be insensitive to the androgen antagonist enzalutamide. Therefore, we examined established CRPC model cells produced by castration of mice bearing hormone-dependent cell line xenografts including CRPC cells overexpressing full-length AR (C4-2) or co-expressing wtAR and splice-variant AR-V7 that is incapable of ligand binding (22Rv1). In standard colony formation assays, C4-2 cells were shown to be androgen-dependent and sensitive to enzalutamide whereas 22Rv1 cells were incapable of colony formation under identical conditions. However, both C4-2 and 22Rv1 cells formed colonies in conditioned media derived from the same cells or from HEK293 fibroblasts that were proven to lack androgenic activity. This effect was (i) not enhanced by androgen, (ii) insensitive to enzalutamide, (iii) dependent on AR (in C4-2) and on AR-V7 and wtAR (in 22Rv1) and (iv) sensitive to inhibitors of several signaling pathways, similar to androgen-stimulation. Therefore, during progression to CRPC in vivo, coordinate cellular changes accompanying overexpression of AR may enable cooperation between hormone-independent activity of AR and actions of cellular secretory factors to completely override androgen-dependence and sensitivity to drugs targeting hormonal factors.",E3

21844499,2011,Chemotherapy-based treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Most men with metastatic prostate cancer respond to various types of androgen ablation but progress to castration-resistant disease. The TAX 327 and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) 99-16 clinical trials established docetaxel-based chemotherapy as preferred first-line treatment for most men with symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, only about half receive benefit from docetaxel, and those who respond initially progress and eventually die of (or with) mCRPC. Both cellular mechanisms and the tumor microenvironment are implicated in the development of resistance to docetaxel. New agents are being evaluated for men with mCRPC, either as first-line treatment in combination with docetaxel, or in men progressing during or after treatment with docetaxel. Thus far, agents evaluated in phase III trials in combination with docetaxel have not improved outcome, including the vaccine GVAX, high-dose vitamin D (DN-101), and the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. In contrast, cabazitaxel, a taxane that is not cross-resistant to docetaxel, substantially improved the outcome of men progressing during or after treatment with docetaxel-based chemotherapy when compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone. However, translation of benefit of cabazitaxel demonstrated in the TROPIC (Treatment of Hormone-Refractory Metastatic Prostate Cancer) trial into general oncologic practice will be challenging because this agent may cause serious toxicity. With the approval of less toxic hormonal agents (eg, abiraterone acetate) in the setting of docetaxel-resistant mCRPC, clinicians will have an opportunity to balance benefits and harms of new agents in an individual patient and may be able to use different agents in sequence.",C2
26030522,2015,Conversion of abiraterone to D4A drives anti-tumour activity in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer resistance to castration occurs because tumours acquire the metabolic capability of converting precursor steroids to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), promoting signalling by the androgen receptor and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Essential for resistance, DHT synthesis from adrenal precursor steroids or possibly from de novo synthesis from cholesterol commonly requires enzymatic reactions by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD), steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes. Abiraterone, a steroidal 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) inhibitor, blocks this synthetic process and prolongs survival. We hypothesized that abiraterone is converted by an enzyme to the more active Δ(4)-abiraterone (D4A), which blocks multiple steroidogenic enzymes and antagonizes the androgen receptor, providing an additional explanation for abiraterone's clinical activity. Here we show that abiraterone is converted to D4A in mice and patients with prostate cancer. D4A inhibits CYP17A1, 3βHSD and SRD5A, which are required for DHT synthesis. Furthermore, competitive androgen receptor antagonism by D4A is comparable to the potent antagonist enzalutamide. D4A also has more potent anti-tumour activity against xenograft tumours than abiraterone. Our findings suggest an additional explanation-conversion to a more active agent-for abiraterone's survival extension. We propose that direct treatment with D4A would be more clinically effective than abiraterone treatment.",A1
18645193,2008,"Phase I clinical trial of a selective inhibitor of CYP17, abiraterone acetate, confirms that castration-resistant prostate cancer commonly remains hormone driven.","Studies indicate that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains driven by ligand-dependent androgen receptor (AR) signaling. To evaluate this, a trial of abiraterone acetate-a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of cytochrome P (CYP) 17, a key enzyme in androgen synthesis-was pursued. Chemotherapy-naïve men (n = 21) who had prostate cancer that was resistant to multiple hormonal therapies were treated in this phase I study of once-daily, continuous abiraterone acetate, which escalated through five doses (250 to 2,000 mg) in three-patient cohorts. Abiraterone acetate was well tolerated. The anticipated toxicities attributable to a syndrome of secondary mineralocorticoid excess-namely hypertension, hypokalemia, and lower-limb edema-were successfully managed with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Antitumor activity was observed at all doses; however, because of a plateau in pharmacodynamic effect, 1,000 mg was selected for cohort expansion (n = 9). Abiraterone acetate administration was associated with increased levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone and steroids upstream of CYP17 and with suppression of serum testosterone, downstream androgenic steroids, and estradiol in all patients. Declines in prostate-specific antigen >or= 30%, 50%, and 90% were observed in 14 (66%), 12 (57%), and 6 (29%) patients, respectively, and lasted between 69 to >or= 578 days. Radiologic regression, normalization of lactate dehydrogenase, and improved symptoms with a reduction in analgesic use were documented. CYP17 blockade by abiraterone acetate is safe and has significant antitumor activity in CRPC. These data confirm that CRPC commonly remains dependent on ligand-activated AR signaling.",A1
26862911,2016,The value of anticancer drugs in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: economic tools for the community oncologist.,"Community oncologists need a simplified methodology for assessing the value of anticancer drugs. In the United States and Europe, costs of anticancer drug were previously estimated at US$50,000 to >US$100,000 per quality adjusted lifeyear (QALY). The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom states that the average cost-effectiveness ratios intervention of >US$50,000 per QALY must be questioned. To design a drug model to estimate the amount in United States dollars (US$) paid for life-year gain (LYG) and QALY, and to apply that model in the treatment of chemo-naïve and chemo-treated patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer (mCRPC). Cost per LYG (cost/LYG) was compared with cost per probability of survival (cost/PoS) calculated as [1.0 minus HR]. Results were expressed in relative values (RV) calculated as US$50,000 or US$100,000 per cost/outcome. In patients with mCRPC, generic docetaxel demonstrated the lowest cost/LYG (US$26,330), lowest cost/ PoS (US$21,942), and the highest RV (3.80-4.56). Cost/LYG of sipuleucel-T was US$272,195, with an RV of 0.37. Significant variation between cost/LYG and cost/PoS was noted among drugs with borderline survival and HR. In previously treated patients, the cost/LYG of cabazitaxel was US$207,240; of abiraterone, US$194,087; enzalutamide, US$223,500; and radium-223 dichloride, US$230,000, all with RVs <0.5. A simplified drug model to weigh cost, survival, and HR with imposed limits on cost/outcome was proposed and applied to patients with mCRPC. The results among that patient population suggested that generic docetaxel had the lowest costs, cost/outcome and the highest RV. Sipuleucel-T, abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223 dichloride, and cabazitaxel were overpriced for their values. Drugs with RVs of <0.5 should be scrutinized, costs negotiated, or other drugs considered, and those with RVs of <0.25, rejected.",A1
24971356,2014,Bioclinical parameters driving decision-making of subsequent lines of treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Different options are available as second-line treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: cabazitaxel, abiraterone, and enzalutamide. Phase III studies evaluating cabazitaxel and the two hormonal agents have been shown to significantly prolong overall survival compared to mitoxantrone and placebo, respectively. Several studies have also demonstrated feasibility and activity of docetaxel rechallenge in case of a sufficient progression-free interval (3-6 months), good performance status, and previous acceptable safety profile, thus providing an additional treatment option in clinical practice. Clinical and biological parameters should be considered to tailor II line treatment. In clinical practice, we can primarily evaluate patients' fitness according to age, performance status, symptomatic disease, comorbidities, and expected safety profile of each drug. Different prognostic/predictive factors may be considered, such as presence of bone-limited or visceral metastases, length of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before chemotherapy, time to progression after docetaxel, Gleason score, PSA doubling time, and serum testosterone, even if their clinical relevance is still debated. This review will discuss current options of innovative drugs sequencing and selection according to bioclinical parameters.",C2
24200698,2013,Cross-resistance between taxanes and new hormonal agents abiraterone and enzalutamide may affect drug sequence choices in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Treatment options for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) have expanded in recent years with the introduction of cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. With new systemic therapies available, the optimal treatment sequence of these drugs in mCRPC becomes increasingly important. As shown recently, patients who had previously been treated with abiraterone showed impaired responses to docetaxel, suggesting clinical cross-resistance [1]. In the present study, we aimed to identify cross-resistance between taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) and the new hormonal agents abiraterone and enzalutamide. As a potential mechanism for cross-resistance, we investigated the effects on androgen receptor (AR) nuclear translocation of these compounds. To identify cross-resistance, we determined the effects of docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide on cell viability in prostate cancer cell lines with acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide. Time-lapse confocal microscopy was used to study the dynamics of AR nuclear translocation. We observed impaired efficacy of docetaxel, cabazitaxel and enzalutamide in the abiraterone-resistant cell line, compared to the non-resistant cell line, providing evidence for in vitro cross-resistance. Impaired efficacy of docetaxel, cabazitaxel and abiraterone was observed in the enzalutamide-resistant cell line. Furthermore, docetaxel and cabazitaxel inhibited AR nuclear translocation, which was also observed for abiraterone and enzalutamide. In conclusion we found substantial preclinical evidence for cross-resistance between the taxanes docetaxel and cabazitaxel, and AR targeting agents abiraterone and enzalutamide. Since these compounds all interfere with AR-signalling, this strongly suggests a common mechanism of action, and thus a potential mechanism for cross-resistance in mCRPC.",A1
27390342,2016,Cotargeting HSP90 and Its Client Proteins for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the later stage of prostate cancer when the disease has stopped responding to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). It has been established that androgen receptor (AR) reactivation is responsible for the recurrence of prostate cancer after ADT. Thus, targeting different pathways that regulate AR stability and activity should be a promising strategy for treatment of CRPC. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are chaperones that modify stability and activity of their client proteins. HSP90, a major player in the HSP family, regulates stability of many proteins, including AR and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of many cell-cycle events. Further, HSP90 is overexpressed in different cancers, including prostate cancer. Herein, we show that cotreatment of prostate cancer with AR antagonist enzalutamide and HSP90 inhibitor leads to more severe cell death due to a synergistic reduction of AR protein. Interestingly, we show that overexpression of Plk1 rescued the synergistic effect and that cotargeting HSP90 and Plk1 also leads to more severe cell death. Mechanistically, we show that E3 ligase CHIP, in addition to targeting AR, is responsible for the degradation of Plk1 as well. These findings suggest that cotargeting HSP90 and some of its client proteins may be a useful strategy in treatment of CRPC. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(9); 2107-18. ©2016 AACR.",E3
21455038,2011,Contemporary management of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"This review will describe the contemporary management of castration-resistant prostate cancer in the context of multiple recent advances. Two novel agents have been added to the therapeutic armamentarium including cabazitaxel and sipuleucel-T. Cabazitaxel, a novel taxane extended survival in men with progressive metastatic CRPC following conventional docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Sipuleucel-T, an autologous dendritic cell based vaccine extended survival in men with relatively asymptomatic metastatic CRPC without visceral metastasis. A third agent, abiraterone acetate, an orally administered CYP17 inhibitor, which suppresses androgen synthesis has been preliminarily reported to significantly prolong survival following prior docetaxel and approval by regulatory agencies is anticipated. Baseline and early changes in circulating tumor cells appear useful as a prognostic factor. Additionally, data demonstrated the superiority of denosumab, a RANK-ligand antagonist, compared to zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal related events in men with bone metastases. Cabazitaxel, sipuleucel-T and denosumab were approved in 2010 by regulatory agencies in the USA for men with metastatic CRPC, and approval of abiraterone acetate is anticipated based on the results of a phase III trial. The evaluation of circulating tumor cells assists in determining prognosis, although its utility for clinical decision-making entails validation.",C2
25131864,2014,[Enzalutamide-a novel androgen receptor inhibitor that provides treatment options for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer].,"The recent emergence of new hormonal or chemotherapeutic drugs has resulted in a paradigm shift in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer(CRPC). Enzalutamide is a rationally designed, orally administered androgen receptor(AR)inhibitor. It inhibits multiple points in the androgen receptor signalling pathway, which is considered an important driver of CRPC, including the inhibition of androgen binding to the AR, nuclear translocation of the AR complex, and binding of the AR complex to deoxyribonucleic acid(DNA). Unlike other anti-androgens(such as bicalutamide), enzalutamide does not act as a partial AR agonist. The first in human phase I/II trial was conducted in the United States in both chemotherapy-naïve patients and postchemotherapy patients with progressive metastatic CRPC(mCRPC). The results showed encouraging antitumor activity of enzalutamide by considering all outcomes assessed in the trial. The first reported phase III trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study involving 1,199 patients with mCRPC that progressed even after docetaxel therapy(AFFIRM trial). Enzalutamide was associated with significant benefits over the placebo considering time-to-event outcomes(i.e. prolonged overall survival[OS], delayed time to prostatic specific antigen[PSA]progression[TTPP], prolonged radiographic progression free survival[rPFS], time to the first skeletal related event[SRE])as well as objective response outcomes(i.e. PSA, soft tissue, and quality of life[QOL]). On the basis of the AFFIRM results, Astellas and Medivation filed a new drug application with the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency in 2012, and obtained their approval. Another phaseI/II enzalutamide trial was conducted in both chemotherapy-naïve patients and post-chemotherapy pa- tients with progressive mCRPC. Enzalutamide at a dose of 160mg/day was well tolerated, and it showed pharmacokinetic characteristics, adverse events, and anti-tumor activity profiles similar to that of the non-Japanese population. On the basis of the results of the studies summarized above, a new drug application was submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan in May 2013 and obtained the approval in Mar 2014. The second phase III trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational study of 1,717 chemotherapy- naïve patients with CRPC(PREVAIL trial). An interim analysis recently demonstrated the significant benefits of enzalutamide over the placebo considering both OS and rPFS. In light of these results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)advised terminating the study early, and suggested treating the patients in the placebo group with enzalutamide. This paper reviews the developmental history of enzalutamide, its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, as well as available efficacy and tolerability data yielded in clinical trials of patients with CRPC.",E3

In 2010, two new treatments, sipuleucel-T and cabazitaxel, were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, based upon improvement in overall survival. The progress that has been made in understanding the biological basis of disease progression, particularly the role of the continued activation of the androgen receptor, have led to new treatments that will further improve survival in these patients. Abiraterone, a drug that depletes both intracellular and extracellular sources of testosterone, demonstrated a 3.9-month improvement in survival in patients who failed docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Other drugs targeting the androgen-receptor axis, such as TAK-700 and MDV3100, have demonstrated significant activity in phase 1 and 2 studies, and are currently in phase 3. Agents that target angiogenesis, bone, and novel apoptotic proteins currently are under investigation, either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy.

23587782,2013,Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.,"Since 2004, docetaxel-based chemotherapy has been the standard of care for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but recently randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of novel agents have shown promise in extending overall survival. These trials have evaluated agents delivered before chemotherapy, to replace or supplement docetaxel, or addressed treatment options for men who have progressed on docetaxel therapy. This review was undertaken to determine which systemic therapies improve cancer- or patient-related outcomes in men with mCRPC. Searches were carried out in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and relevant conference proceedings. Eligible articles included RCTs comparing systemic therapy or combination (excluding primary or secondary androgen deprivation therapy, bone protective agents or radionuclides) with placebo or other agents in men with mCRPC. Twenty-five RCTs met the selection criteria. In chemotherapy-naive patients, targeted therapy with tasquinimod conferred a benefit in progression-free survival. Immunotherapy with sipuleucel-T extended overall survival and was well tolerated, but had no effect on the time to disease progression. Hypercastration with abiraterone extended progression-free survival, whereas overall survival was improved but not statistically proven. In the chemotherapy setting, updated and new trials of docetaxel alone confirmed the survival benefit seen in previous studies. A survival benefit with the addition of estramustine to docetaxel shown in a previous study did not lead to an improvement in pain palliation or quality of life. Trials of combining targeted therapies with docetaxel generally did not extend survival. The addition of bevacizumab improved progression-free survival, but not overall survival. The addition of GVAX immunotherapy or calcitriol was harmful. In the post-chemotherapy setting, progression-free and overall survival benefits were detected with cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide. Cabazitaxel was associated with greater toxicity, whereas abiraterone and enzalutamide had less severe adverse effects. Satraplatin and sunitinib both extended progression-free survival, but did not improve overall survival. Docetaxel-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care in men with mCRPC who are candidates for palliative systemic therapy. Promising results are emerging with sipuleucel-T and abiraterone in the pre-docetaxel setting and cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide in patients who progress on or after docetaxel. Further research to determine the optimal choice, sequence or even the combination of these agents is necessary.",C2
26997363,2016,Understanding taxanes in prostate cancer; importance of intratumoral drug accumulation.,"Resistance to docetaxel is common in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and may be caused by sub-therapeutic intratumoral drug concentrations. Cabazitaxel demonstrated survival benefit in docetaxel-pretreated and docetaxel-refractory patients. In this study, we investigated whether the superior antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in mCRPC is explained by higher intratumoral cabazitaxel levels. Since recent studies suggest a reduced efficacy of docetaxel following treatment with novel androgen receptor (AR)-targeted agents, we also investigated taxane efficacy in an enzalutamide-resistant tumor model. Intratumoral concentrations of docetaxel and cabazitaxel were correlated with antitumor activity in docetaxel-naïve, docetaxel-resistant, and enzalutamide-resistant patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of prostate cancer. Intratumoral drug levels were negatively related to intrinsic and acquired resistance to docetaxel. Also, the observed stronger antitumor activity of cabazitaxel was associated with increased cumulative exposure and higher intratumoral of cabazitaxel concentrations in all PDXs. The superior antitumor activity of cabazitaxel in docetaxel- and enzalutamide-resistant tumors can be partly attributed to higher intratumoral drug concentrations. Especially for patients who are intrinsically resistant to docetaxel resulting from suboptimal intratumoral docetaxel concentrations, cabazitaxel may be the preferred chemotherapeutic agent.

We have demonstrated that abiraterone, a selective androgen biosynthesis inhibitor, is a safe and active therapeutic option in a subgroup of 47 very elderly adults (aged > 80 years) enrolled in the Italian named patient program, with a tolerability profile and clinical outcomes comparable to those of younger population. Prostate cancer mainly affects elderly men, who are often frail and whose reduced physiological reserves and multiple comorbidities increase the risk of side effects. The availability of new drugs has improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) but has increased the number of very elderly CRPC patients receiving anticancer drugs, raising questions about their efficacy and safety in this population. We assessed the tolerability of abiraterone (AA) in a cohort of very elderly adults with metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) enrolled in the Italian AA named patient program and analyzed their clinical outcomes. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 47 mCRPC patients aged > 80 years who had received AA after docetaxel. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate OS and progression-free survival (PFS). Safety and clinical outcomes were also analyzed by age group (< 80 and > 80 years). Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the differences in PFS and OS between the groups according to the stratification variables. In very elderly men, the prostate-specific antigen response rate was 48.9%, and the median PFS and OS were 8 and 18 months, respectively. The differences in toxicities between the older and younger age groups were not major. The limitation of the present study was mainly its retrospective nature. Our data show that AA is active and safe in very elderly patients and leads to outcomes similar to those observed in younger patients, thus confirming that AA is a manageable therapeutic option for this patient population.",A1

Little information exists regarding the sequences in which new therapies for mCRPC with evidence of survival benefits are used. To describe the sequence of medication use for patients with mCRPC as observed in 3 healthcare data sets. Three healthcare claims data sets were used to identify patients with mCRPC who had no previous use of and were newly initiating 1 of the 2 oral study drugs (ie, abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide). The index date was the first study drug claim after September 1, 2012. Patients were followed until the data cutoff or until being lost to follow-up. Descriptive statistics summarized the proportion of patients receiving 1 line of therapy versus ≥2 lines of therapy. The use of a corticosteroid and the mean monthly pharmacy costs of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide during the follow-up period were compared between the cohorts. A total of 3525 patients with mCRPC were identified from data set 1, 499 patients from data set 2, and 1949 patients from data set 3. The first-line use of abiraterone acetate was observed in 74%, 82%, and 80% of data sets 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and the first-line use of enzalutamide was seen in 26%, 18%, and 20%, respectively, of these same populations. The concomitant use of corticosteroids was observed in patients receiving first-line abiraterone acetate and in patients receiving first-line enzalutamide in all 3 data sets. After September 2012, abiraterone acetate was the most frequently administered therapy for mCRPC among the 2 oral agents, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide. The monthly pharmacy costs associated with abiraterone acetate were significantly lower than those associated with enzalutamide in all 3 data sets. Based on the data used in this study, abiraterone acetate was more frequently administered for patients with mCRPC than enzalutamide. The concomitant use of corticosteroids was common in patients receiving first-line abiraterone acetate or first-line enzalutamide therapy. Patients receiving abiraterone acetate had significantly lower monthly pharmacy costs than patients receiving enzalutamide.

In this review we present the standard of care of metastatic prostate cancer by disease stage (hormone naive/ hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer, non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, oligometastatic/multimetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer) and the emerging treatment modalities presently assessed in clinical trials. We would also like to give advice on debatable aspects of the management of metastatic prostate cancer.",C2
19470933,2009,Selective inhibition of CYP17 with abiraterone acetate is highly active in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"It has been postulated that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) commonly remains hormone dependent. Abiraterone acetate is a potent, selective, and orally available inhibitor of CYP17, the key enzyme in androgen and estrogen biosynthesis. This was a phase I/II study of abiraterone acetate in castrate, chemotherapy-naive CRPC patients (n = 54) with phase II expansion at 1,000 mg (n = 42) using a two-stage design to reject the null hypothesis if more than seven patients had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of > or = 50% (null hypothesis = 0.1; alternative hypothesis = 0.3; alpha = .05; beta = .14). Computed tomography scans every 12 weeks and circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration were performed. Prospective reversal of resistance at progression by adding dexamethasone 0.5 mg/d to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone and upstream steroids was pursued. A decline in PSA of > or = 50% was observed in 28 (67%) of 42 phase II patients, and declines of > or = 90% were observed in eight (19%) of 42 patients. Independent radiologic evaluation reported partial responses (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) in nine (37.5%) of 24 phase II patients with measurable disease. Decreases in CTC counts were also documented. The median time to PSA progression (TTPP) on abiraterone acetate alone for all phase II patients was 225 days (95% CI, 162 to 287 days). Exploratory analyses were performed on all 54 phase I/II patients; the addition of dexamethasone at disease progression reversed resistance in 33% of patients regardless of prior treatment with dexamethasone, and pretreatment serum androgen and estradiol levels were associated with a probability of > or = 50% PSA decline and TTPP on abiraterone acetate and dexamethasone. CYP17 blockade by abiraterone acetate results in declines in PSA and CTC counts and radiologic responses, confirming that CRPC commonly remains hormone driven.",A1
19962664,2009,Steroid hormone receptors in prostate cancer: a hard habit to break?,"The clinical data from abiraterone acetate and MDV-3100 confirm continued androgen receptor (AR) addiction in a significant proportion of castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). However, patients nearly invariably progress with a rise in prostate-specific antigen, suggesting resumption of transcription of hormone-regulated genes. If CRPC remains addicted to steroid receptor signaling, including, but not exclusive, to AR, how does reactivation occur? Or if cancers lose this addiction, do they remain driven by the same oncogenic mechanisms? The future development of therapeutics for CRPC should be informed by an understanding of the mechanisms underlying disease progression following treatment with these novel agents.",A1
22552048,2013,Efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy following ketoconazole in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: implications for prior therapy in clinical trials.,"Abiraterone acetate (AA) is a CYP17 inhibitor of androgen synthesis approved for use following docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); evaluation in the pre-docetaxel setting is ongoing. Given that the reported efficacy of AA is lower following docetaxel vs. pre-docetaxel, the potential exists for cross resistance given docetaxel's partly androgen receptor targeting activity. The efficacy of docetaxel following ketoconazole (KC), a weaker and nonspecific inhibitor of CYP17, may provide some insights into this potential interaction. We retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of every 3-week docetaxel with prednisone (DP) in mCRPC previously exposed to KC compared to KC-naive patients. A randomized phase II trial of men with mCRPC treated with DP + AT-101 (bcl-2 inhibitor) vs. DP plus placebo was analyzed. Both arms were combined for analysis as no significant differences were seen. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response (ORR), pain, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were estimated with and without prior KC. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the effect of covariates on OS. Of 220 evaluable men, 40 (18.2%) received prior KC. The median OS with DP-based therapy of KC-naive patients (18.3 months, 95% CI: 15.0, 24.5) and post-KC patients (17.0 months, 95% CI: 9.9, 20.4) was not statistically different (P = 0.20). After controlling for prognostic classifications, analyses demonstrated consistent trends for worsening of OS after KC, with (hazard ratios (HRs) 1.33-1.46. Similar unfavorable trends were observed for ORR, PSA declines, and PFS. In this hypothesis-generating analysis, patients treated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy following prior KC had numerically and consistently worse outcomes than patients not exposed to prior KC. Although the estimated differences did not attain statistical significance, evaluation of outcomes with docetaxel in particular, and all classes of novel and emerging agents following AA, is of clinical importance, given its more potent androgen synthesis inhibition compared with KC. Drug development should take into account the potential impact of previous therapy.",A1
25621779,2015,[Treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer].,"The treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) represents one of the oncological fields where the most impressive improvements has been observed in the last decades. At the beginning of this century, the expected survival of mCRPC patients was not more than 12 months. After the introduction of docetaxel in the clinical practice in 2004, and the recent availability of new drugs cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and radium-223 the landscape is dramatically changed with an expected median survival of about three years. The possibility of administering docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide as first line treatment, and cabazitaxel, abiretone acetate, and enzalutamide as second line, as well as the availability of radium-223 for the treatment of mCRPC patients regardless of chemotherapy administration, changed the natural history of the disease. At the same time, it is probable that also the biology of the disease is changing with the appearance of mechanisms of resistance which are common to all the drugs. This plays a central role in sequencing the available drugs not only in the first and second line setting but also beyond the second line. The future challenges for the oncologists will be to develop new drugs able to overcome the resistances, mainly when they are native, to find the optimal sequence to optimize the use of available drugs, to place at the best place other active drugs, such as vaccines and radiopharmaceuticals, to exploit the new drugs also in a hormone-sensitive phase.",A1
23316941,2013,Radium-223 for the treatment of prostate cancer.,"Bone metastases cause significant morbidity and mortality in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Until recently, treatment options have been limited, but now six drugs are known to extend life expectancy, with docetaxel the current standard first-line cytotoxic therapy. Phase III studies have also shown a survival advantage for sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide and radium-223 . Radium-223 is unique among these agents, as the only bone-directed therapy shown to prolong survival in CRPC. This review covers the current standard of care for CRPC and recent drug developments that have demonstrated a survival benefit. It focuses on bone-directed therapies, in particular radium-223, the first-in-class alpha-emitting radionuclide and discusses the pivotal studies to date. A PubMed search using the keywords below was performed. Radium-223 is set to become a new standard of care for the treatment of bony metastatic CRPC. It improves both survival and quality of life, delays skeletal events and is well tolerated. Its optimal use in the evolving treatment strategies for men with CRPC and bone metastases is yet to be determined.",C2
22950608,2013,Cabazitaxel: a novel drug for hormone-refractory prostate cancer.,"Cabazitaxel has recently been approved by FDA for the treatment of docetaxel resistant hormone-refractory prostate cancer. It has been developed by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name of Jevtana. It is given in combination with prednisone/prednisolone and has passed the clinical trial over well-known drug mitoxantrone. This drug is a microtubule depolymerization inhibitor, which can penetrate blood brain barrier (BBB). The FDA granted fast track designation to this drug in November 2009 and thereafter, new drug application submission was done in March 2010. Priority review to this drug was granted in April 2010 and finally in July 2010 it was approved by FDA. It is available in the form of injection in the dose of 60 mg/1.5 mL, which should be diluted prior to its use by the diluents supplied along with the injection. It is a second-line drug and has proven to be effective in patients experiencing docetaxel based treatment failure.",C2
23326489,2013,Sox2 is an androgen receptor-repressed gene that promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"Despite advances in detection and therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer continues to be a major clinical problem. The aberrant activity of stem cell pathways, and their regulation by the Androgen Receptor (AR), has the potential to provide insight into novel mechanisms and pathways to prevent and treat advanced, castrate-resistant prostate cancers. To this end, we investigated the role of the embryonic stem cell regulator Sox2 [SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2] in normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. In the normal prostate, Sox2 is expressed in a portion of basal epithelial cells. Prostate tumors were either Sox2-positive or Sox2-negative, with the percentage of Sox2-positive tumors increasing with Gleason Score and metastases. In the castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line CWR-R1, endogenous expression of Sox2 was repressed by AR signaling, and AR chromatin-IP shows that AR binds the enhancer element within the Sox2 promoter. Likewise, in normal prostate epithelial cells and human embryonic stem cells, increased AR signaling also decreases Sox2 expression. Resistance to the anti-androgen MDV3100 results in a marked increase in Sox2 expression within three prostate cancer cell lines, and in the castration-sensitive LAPC-4 prostate cancer cell line ectopic expression of Sox2 was sufficient to promote castration-resistant tumor formation. Loss of Sox2 expression in the castration-resistant CWR-R1 prostate cancer cell line inhibited cell growth. Up-regulation of Sox2 was not associated with increased CD133 expression but was associated with increased FGF5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 5) expression. These data propose a model of elevated Sox2 expression due to loss of AR-mediated repression during castration, and consequent castration-resistance via mechanisms not involving induction of canonical embryonic stem cell pathways.",E3
23717582,2013,Therapeutic options in docetaxel-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis.,"Docetaxel is an established first-line therapy to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Recently, abiraterone and cabazitaxel were approved for use after docetaxel failure, with improved survival. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations were negative for both abiraterone (now positive in final recommendation) and cabazitaxel (negative in final recommendation). To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone, cabazitaxel, mitoxantrone and prednisone for mCRPC treatment in US. A decision-tree model was constructed to compare the two mCRPC treatments versus two placebos over 18 months from a societal perspective. Chance nodes include baseline pain as a severity indicator, grade III/IV side-effects, and survival at 18 months. Probabilities, survival and health utilities were from published studies. Model cost inputs included drug treatment, side-effect management and prevention, radiation for pain, and death associated costs in 2010 US dollars. Abiraterone is a cost-effective choice at $94K/QALY (quality adjusted life years) compared to placebo in our base-case analysis. Cabazitaxel and abiraterone are the most effective, yet also most expensive agents. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) at base-case are $101K/QALY (extended dominated) for mitoxantrone vs. placebo, $91K/QALY for abiraterone vs. mitoxantrone, $956K/QALY for cabazitaxel vs. abiraterone. Abiraterone becomes less cost-effective as its AWP increases, or if the cost of mitoxantrone side-effect management decreases. Increases in the percentage of patients with baseline pain leads to an increased ICER for both mitoxantrone and abiraterone, but mitoxantrone does relatively better. Cabazitaxel remains not cost-effective. Our base case model suggests that abiraterone is a cost-effective option in docetaxel-refractory mCRPC patients. Newer treatments will also need a CEA assessment compared to abiraterone.",C2
27210425,2016,The safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.,"Enzalutamide - a non-steroidal second-generation antiandrogen - represents an active treatment option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in both chemotherapy-naïve and docetaxel-pretreated settings, based on the demonstration of improved overall survival over placebo in two large phase III trials. The therapeutic landscape of mCRPC, narrowed to docetaxel until recently, encompasses now several treatments of a different nature (including androgen receptor targeting agents, taxanes, radiometabolic therapy, and immunotherapy), improving considerably the patients prognosis. However, direct comparisons between these agents still lack, raising the question of the optimal sequence of treatment. Expert commentary: We described in detail available data on clinical efficacy and safety of enzalutamide in different clinical settings (chemotherapy-naïve and -pretreated mCRPC patients), analyzing patients characteristics, the effects of enzalutamide on major clinical outcomes and its impact on patients quality of life. Finally, we briefly overviewed ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential active combinations, cross-resistance with other compounds, sequential strategies, and possible prognostic or predictive biomarkers.",E3
27544669,2016,Enzalutamide as a Fourth- or Fifth-Line Treatment Option for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,"To evaluate the efficacy of enzalutamide (Enz) as fourth- or fifth-line treatment in men with metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), by analyzing a retrospective cohort of heavily pretreated patients. We evaluated toxicity, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression data from 47 CRPC patients treated with fourth- or fifth-line Enz. All patients were treated with docetaxel and abiraterone acetate and 42 patients (89%) with cabazitaxel. The median age of the patients was 69 years (IQR, 63-73.5), 79% had bone metastases, 55% had lymph node metastases, and 17% had visceral metastases. The median duration of Enz treatment was 12.0 weeks (IQR, 8.3-20.4), and 11 patients (23%) responded to Enz (maximum PSA decline ≥50%). In general, Enz was well tolerated, with the most frequently reported adverse events being fatigue and nausea. The median OS was 40.1 weeks (95% CI, 25.4-61.4), the median PFS was 12.1 weeks (95% CI, 9.9-14.0) and the median time to PSA progression was 15.7 weeks (95% CI, 14.0-28.7). Analysis of this retrospective cohort suggests that Enz is well tolerated and that there is a 23% response rate in heavily pretreated CRPC patients, which is comparable with third-line treatment outcomes.",C2
26336104,2015,ATM Inhibition Potentiates Death of Androgen Receptor-inactivated Prostate Cancer Cells with Telomere Dysfunction.,"Androgen receptor (AR) plays a role in maintaining telomere stability in prostate cancer cells, as AR inactivation induces telomere dysfunction within 3 h. Since telomere dysfunction in other systems is known to activate ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways, we investigated the role of ATM-mediated DDR signaling in AR-inactivated prostate cancer cells. Indeed, the induction of telomere dysfunction in cells treated with AR-antagonists (Casodex or MDV3100) or AR-siRNA was associated with a dramatic increase in phosphorylation (activation) of ATM and its downstream effector Chk2 and the presenceof phosphorylated ATM at telomeres, indicating activation of DDR signaling at telomeres. Moreover, Casodex washout led to the reversal of telomere dysfunction, indicating repair of damaged telomeres. ATM inhibitor blocked ATM phosphorylation, induced PARP cleavage, abrogated cell cycle checkpoint activation and attenuated the formation of γH2AX foci at telomeres in AR-inactivated cells, suggesting that ATM inhibitor induces apoptosis in AR-inactivated cells by blocking the repair of damaged DNA at telomeres. Finally, colony formation assay revealed a dramatic decrease in the survival of cells co-treated with Casodex and ATM inhibitor as compared with those treated with either Casodex or ATM inhibitor alone. These observations indicate that inhibitors of DDR signaling pathways may offer a unique opportunity to enhance the potency of AR-targeted therapies for the treatment of androgen-sensitive as well as castration-resistant prostate cancer.",E3

27194471,2016,Inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"The precise molecular alterations driving castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are not clearly understood. Using a novel network-based integrative approach, here, we show distinct alterations in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to be critical for CRPC. Expression of HBP enzyme glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1) is found to be significantly decreased in CRPC compared with localized prostate cancer (PCa). Genetic loss-of-function of GNPNAT1 in CRPC-like cells increases proliferation and aggressiveness, in vitro and in vivo. This is mediated by either activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in cells expressing full-length androgen receptor (AR) or by specific protein 1 (SP1)-regulated expression of carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) in cells containing AR-V7 variant. Strikingly, addition of the HBP metabolite UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to CRPC-like cells significantly decreases cell proliferation, both in-vitro and in animal studies, while also demonstrates additive efficacy when combined with enzalutamide in-vitro. These observations demonstrate the therapeutic value of targeting HBP in CRPC.",E3
23091116,2012,Cabazitaxel: more than a new taxane for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer?,"The taxanes are recognized as a major class of chemotherapeutic agents; however, mechanisms of innate and acquired resistance can limit their usefulness. Cabazitaxel, a novel taxane with microtubule-stabilizing potency similar to docetaxel, exhibits activity against tumor cell lines resistant to paclitaxel and docetaxel. Cabazitaxel showed linear pharmacokinetics and a terminal elimination half-life comparable with that of docetaxel, findings which support dosing as a single infusion in three-week treatment cycles. Dose-ranging studies recommended doses of 20 or 25 mg/m(2) every three weeks. Antitumor activity was shown in patients with advanced cancer and chemotherapy failure (including taxane failure). Other early studies investigated the efficacy of cabazitaxel in pretreated metastatic breast cancer, either as a single agent or in combination with capecitabine. Objective antitumor response rates of up to 24% and sustained tumor stabilizations were also observed. The TROPIC phase III study, conducted in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with docetaxel, established cabazitaxel as the first chemotherapeutic agent to offer a survival advantage in this patient population. Across these studies, the dose-limiting hematologic toxicity was neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia), usually controllable with colony-stimulating factor/granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support.",C2

Advanced prostate cancer is initially sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy, but usually progresses to the castration-resistant state. There is now incontrovertible evidence that castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains hormone driven, with intratumoral steroid synthesis fueling tumor growth. Several novel agents targeted androgen receptor signaling are currently being evaluated including abiraterone and MDV3100. Recent results of the phase III trial of abiraterone acetate in post-docetaxel patients has shown an overall survival benefit in advanced CRPC. This new treatment is likely to become a new standard of care for patients with metastatic CRPC.",A1

The main treatment for incurable stages of disease is surgical or pharmacological castration. However, with time and despite the addition of anti-androgens, the disease progresses to a clinical state that has been commonly referred to as hormone refractory. In recent years, the concept of hormone refractoriness has been challenged and replaced by castration resistance, acknowledging that further and optimal hormonal manipulation can be attained, beyond achieving testosterone levels at castration range. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent therapeutic breakthroughs in the management of metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), with greater emphasis in the newer hormonal therapy agents such as Abiraterone and Enzalutamide. Future combination and sequential treatment strategies are contextualized in the current era of personalized cancer medicine and genomic characterization of prostate cancer.",A1

However, metastatic CRPC has also AR-independent survival pathway which leads to lethal phenotype by either adaptation or clonal selection resistant mechanism after AR targeted therapy. There are many studies regarding the progression mechanisms without AR signal transduction, such as growth factor, anti-apoptotic factor, and PTEN/mTOR pathway and so on. Also, cancer microenvironment and cancer stem cell is a hot research area for CRPC. It is very important to repress both AR-dependent and -independent signaling pathway to improve the clinical outcome in CRPC patients. Application of the new technology, such as next generation sequencing, would be developing for the prostate cancer research, providing pre-clinical proof-of-principle as a promising approach in CRPC.",A1

However, as the tumor cells become resistant to docetaxel-based therapy, disease progression is inevitable, and until recently there was no further available treatment beyond palliative care. In June 2010, cabazitaxel, a next-generation taxane, was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of mCRPC that has progressed after docetaxel therapy. This article describes the background and rationale of cabazitaxel's development and the clinical study program that led to its FDA approval, focusing on the Phase III TROPIC trial that demonstrated the efficacy of cabazitaxel plus prednisone in the treatment of mCRPC.

24775722,2014,Secondary hormonal manipulation in castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the single common pathway to prostate cancer death. For men with symptomatic metastatic disease, docetaxel chemotherapy remains a standard of care. However, blood prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) testing allows the identification of CRPC before clinical metastases or symptoms occur, providing a long diagnostic lead time in many patients. The use of secondary hormonal manipulations (SHMs) in men not candidates for immediate chemotherapy is reviewed. PubMed was searched for randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews or clinical practice guidelines addressing SHMs in CRPC. A recent systematic review and practice guideline was identified, and used as the evidence base for this review along with reports from randomized trials over the past year. The goals of therapy with SHMs should be discussed with patients and their preferences considered. In men without clinical evidence of metastases, gonadal androgen suppression should be maintained and generally patients should be observed. There is no clear evidence that SHMs are of benefit in these patients. Abiraterone plus prednisone is of proven benefit in men with CRPC metastases who are without significant symptoms prior to chemotherapy. Based on emerging data, enzalutamide may be of similar benefit. Use of other SHMs should be based on patient preference and consideration of possible adverse effects; with the exception of low dose prednisone, there is little evidence of benefit supporting their use. For patients accepting these uncertainties, a trial of nonsteroidal antiandrogen may be considered as an adjunct to observation, followed by low dose corticosteroid with immediate or delayed addition of abiraterone (in men with metastases) as a reasonable next step.",A1

The study included 56 patients diagnosed with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer who were previously treated with abiraterone therapy at four oncology centers in Turkey. With abiraterone, the patients had a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 5.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI) for hazard ratio (HR) (4.4-7.4)) and an overall survival of 13.4 months (95% CI for HR (5.5-21.3)). When we compared the disease-free survival (DFS) of reference patients treated with cabazitaxel as a second-line treatment with those receiving second-line abiraterone therapy, there was no significant difference. (PFS = 5.9 months with cabazitaxel vs. 6.7 months with abiraterone, P = 0.213).

22856665,2012,New strategies against prostate cancer--Pt(II)-based chemotherapy.,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and the sixth cause of cancer-related death in men. When hormone therapy fails to control tumour growth, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) occurs and chemotherapy drugs must be administered. Since 2004, docetaxel administration is the standard of care in metastatic CRPC, although it presents severe limitations such as acquired resistance and poor prognosis. An analogue (cabazitaxel) was approved by the FDA in 2010 as a second-line chemotherapeutic agent. Novel immuno- and hormonal therapy agents, as well as tumour vaccines, have been recently developed, but new strategies are still needed for effectively handling this type of neoplasia. Platinum compounds, in particular, have been the object of a growing interest, despite the former belief that they should have modest activity against prostate cancer. Compounds such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin or satraplatin, either alone or in combination, have lately shown promising results. In order to overcome the deleterious side-effects usually associated to these metal-based agents, several approaches have been followed with a view to optimise drug delivery and targeting, some of which showed considerable success in CRPC. Platinum drugs may therefore have an important role in the chemotherapeutic management of human metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, mostly in second-line strategies. The present review addresses the most relevant studies on platinum-based antineoplastic agents towards CRPC in the last decade--from first--and second-generation complexes to newly developed compounds.",C2
24342031,2014,Pre-chemotherapy abiraterone acetate. A proposal of a treatment algorithm in castration resistant prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer treatment remains a challenge for the urologist. Medical control in locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer is usually performed with LHRH analogues and/or antiandrogens. Different treatments have been proposed when there is biochemical and clinical progression of the disease and other new ones have changed the patients' perspective and life expectancy. This review has aimed to establish the current role of Abiraterone Acetate in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer and facilitate decision-making by the Urologist by means of a Treatment Algorithm. A search of current evidence on Abiraterone treatment in patients with castration- resistant metastatic prostate cancer was performed in PubMed, mainly analyzing those studies designed as clinical trials. In addition, we reviewed and updated the role of hormone therapy and androgen receptors in prostate cancer. There are currently basically two clinical trials that demonstrate the effectiveness of Abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer compared to placebo. The study COU-AA 302 shows a clear benefit with Abiraterone prior to chemotherapy in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, this making it possible to establish an algorithm for initial treatment that facilitates decision-making by the urologist. Abiraterone is a pre-chemotherapy treatment option in selected patients with castration resistant metastatic prostate cancer, although it is necessary to improve the cost and to design more multicenter clinical trials to optimize the cost/benefit ratio.",A1
26337241,2015,Improvement in survival and quality of life with new therapeutic agents in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: comparison among the results.,"Androgen deprivation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for men affected by metastatic prostate cancer (PC). Unfortunately, nearly all patient will become resistant to the initial hormonal approach, developing a metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). For many years, chemotherapy with docetaxel has been the only established standard of care for men with mCRPC. Recent developments in the knowledge of the disease biology have shown that during the progression to the castrate status PC remains dependent on androgens and androgen receptor (AR) pathway. As a consequence, new agents like abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide have been rapidly developed and approved for clinical use. Other drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as sipuleucel-T, cabazitaxel, and radium-223 have shown to improve overall survival, symptom control and quality of life of mCRPC patients. However, the optimal sequencing and combination of these treatments are not defined yet. Studies on biomarkers for treatment selection, such as AR splice variants, are promising, but the initial data still need prospective validation on large patient series.",C2
